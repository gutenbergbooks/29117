<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">About</span> twenty-five years ago I commenced
investigating the history of obsolete
punishments, and the result of my studies first
appeared in the newspapers and magazines. In
1881 was issued "Punishments in the Olden
Time," and in 1890 was published "Old Time
Punishments": both works were well received
by the press and the public, quickly passing out
of print, and are not now easily obtainable. I
contributed in 1894 to the Rev. Canon Erskine
Clarke's popular monthly, the <i>Parish Magazine</i>, a
series of papers entitled "Public Punishments of
the Past." The foregoing have been made the
foundation of the present volume; in nearly every
instance I have re-written the articles, and provided
additional chapters. This work is given to the
public as my final production on this subject, and
I trust it may receive a welcome similar to that
accorded to my other books, and throw fresh light
on some of the lesser known byways of history.</p>

<p class="fgcp"><span class="dcap">he</span> usual mode of capital punishment
in England for many
centuries has been, and still
is, hanging. Other means of
execution have been exercised,
but none have been so general as death
at the hands of the hangman. In the Middle
Ages every town, abbey, and nearly all the more
important manorial lords had the right of
hanging, and the gallows was to be seen almost
everywhere.</p>

<p>Representatives of the church often possessed
rights in respect to the gallows and its victims.
William the Conqueror invested the Abbot of
Battle Abbey with authority to save the life of any
malefactor he might find about to be executed,
and whose life he wished to spare. In the days of
Edward I. the Abbot of Peterborough set up a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
gallows at Collingham, Nottinghamshire, and
hanged thereon a thief. This proceeding came
under the notice of the Bishop of Lincoln, who,
with considerable warmth of temper, declared
the Abbot had usurped his rights, since he held
from the king's predecessors the liberty of the
Wapentake of Collingham and the right of executing
criminals. The Abbot declared that
Henry III. had given him and his successors "Infangthefe
and Utfangthefe in all his hundreds and
demesnes." After investigation it was decided
that the Abbot was in the wrong, and he was
directed to take down the gallows he had erected.
One, and perhaps the chief reason of the prelate
being so particular to retain his privileges was on
account of its entitling him to the chattels of the
condemned man.</p>

<p>Little regard was paid for human life in the
reign of Edward I. In the year 1279, not fewer
than two hundred and eighty Jews were hanged
for clipping coin, a crime which has brought many
to the gallows. The following historic story
shows how slight an offence led to death in this
monarch's time. In 1285, at the solicitation of
Quivil, the Bishop of Exeter, Edward I. visited
Exeter to enquire into the circumstances relating<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to the assassination of Walter Lichdale, a precentor
of the cathedral, who had been killed one day
when returning from matins. The murderer made
his escape during the night and could not be
found. The Mayor, Alfred Dunport, who had
held the office on eight occasions, and the porter
of the Southgate, were both tried and found guilty
of a neglect of duty in omitting to fasten the town
gate, by which means the murderer escaped from
the hands of justice. Both men were condemned
to death, and afterwards executed. The unfortunate
mayor and porter had not anything to do with
the death of the precentor, their only crime being
that of not closing the city gate at night, a truly
hard fate for neglect of duty.</p>

<p>A hanging reign was that of Henry VIII. It
extended over thirty-seven years, and during that
period it is recorded by Stow that 72,000 criminals
were executed.</p>

<p>In bygone times were observed some curious
ordinances for the conduct of the Court of
Admiralty of the Humber. Enumerated are the
various offences of a maritime character, and
their punishment. In view of the character of the
court, the punishment was generally to be inflicted
at low-water mark, so as to be within the proper<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
jurisdiction of the Admiralty, the chief officer of
which, the Admiral of the Humber, being from
the year 1451, the Mayor of Hull. The court
being met, and consisting of "masters, merchants,
and mariners, with all others that do enjoy the
King's stream with hook, net, or any engine,"
were addressed as follows: "You masters of the
quest, if you, or any of you, discover or disclose
anything of the King's secret counsel, or of the
counsel of your fellows (for the present you are
admitted to be the King's Counsellors), you are to
be, and shall be, had down to the low-water mark,
where must be made three times, O Yes! for the
King, and then and there this punishment, by the
law prescribed, shall be executed upon them; that
is, their hands and feet bound, their throats cut,
their tongues pulled out, and their bodies thrown
into the sea." The ordinances which they were
bound to observe, include the following: "You
shall inquire, whether any man in port or creek
have stolen any ropes, nets, cords, etc., amounting
to the value of ninepence; if he have, he must be
hanged for the said crimes, at low-water mark."
"If any person has removed the anchor of any
ships, without licence of the master or mariners,
or both, or if anyone cuts the cable of a ship at<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
anchor, or removes or cuts away a buoy; for any
of the said offences, he shall be hanged at low-water
mark." "All breakers open of chests, or
pickers of locks, coffers, or chests, etc., on shipboard,
if under the value of one and twenty pence,
they shall suffer forty days' imprisonment; but,
if above, they must be hanged as aforesaid." "If
any loderman takes upon himself the rule of any
ship, and she perishes through his carelessness
and negligence, if he comes to land alive with two
of his company, they two may chop off his head
without any further suit with the King or his
Admiralty." The sailor element of the population
of the olden days was undeniably rude and
refractory, the above rules showing that the
authorities needed stern and swift measures to
repress evildoers of that class.</p>

<p>A curious Derbyshire story is told, taking us
back to Tudor times, illustrating the strange superstitions
and the power exercised by the nobility in
that era. Some three hundred years ago the Peak
of Derbyshire was ruled by the iron hand of Sir
George Vernon, who, from the boundless magnificence
of his hospitality at the famous Hall of
Haddon, was known throughout the country
round as the "King of the Peak." His "kingly"<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
character was further supported by the stern
severity with which he dealt with all cases of
dispute or crime that came before him, even when
human life was concerned; though it must be
added, that if strict, he was also just. The following
is an instance of his arbitrary and decisive
manner of dealing with the lives of those who
came beneath his control, and shows his fondness
for the exercise of the summary processes of
lynch-law. A wandering pedlar was one morning
found dead in an unfrequented part, evidently
murdered. He had been hawking his goods
about the neighbourhood the previous day, and
was in the evening observed to enter a certain
cottage, and after that was not again seen alive. No
sooner had Sir George Vernon become acquainted
with these facts than he caused the body to be conveyed
to the hall, where it was laid. The man
occupying the cottage where the pedlar had last
been seen alive was then summoned to attend at
the hall immediately, and on arriving was met by
the question, what had become of the pedlar who
had gone into his cottage on the previous evening?
The fellow repudiated any knowledge of him
whatever, when the "King of the Peak" turned
round, drew off the sheet which had been placed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
over the dead body, and ordered that everyone
present should successively approach and touch it,
declaring at the same time each his innocence of
the foul murder. The cottar, who had retained
his effrontery until now, shrank from the ordeal,
and declined to touch the body, running at once
out of the hall, through Bakewell village, in the
direction of Ashford. Sir George, coming, as he
well might, to the conclusion that the suspicions
which had pointed to this man had been well
founded, ordered his men to take horse and
pursue the murderer, and, overtaking him, to hang
him on the spot. They did so; he was caught in
a field opposite to where the toll-bar of Ashford
stood, and there instantly hanged. The field is still
called "Galley Acre," or "Gallows Acre," on this
account. It is stated that for this exercise of his
powers in summary justice Sir George was called
upon to appear at London and answer for the act.
When he appeared in court he was the first and
second time summoned to surrender as the "King
of the Peak," but not replying to these, the third
time he was called by his proper title of Sir
George Vernon, upon which he acknowledged his
presence, stepping forward and crying "Here am
I." The indictment having been made out<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
against him under the title of "King of the Peak"
it was of no effect, and the worst consequence to
Sir George was that he received an admonition.
He died in 1567, the possessor of thirty Derbyshire
manors, and was buried in Bakewell Church,
where his altar tomb remains to this day.</p>

<p>Out of the beaten track of the tourist are the
gallows at Melton Ross, Lincolnshire, with their
romantic history going back to the time when
might and not right ruled the land. According
to a legend current among the country folk in the
locality long, long ago, some lads were playing at
hanging, and trying who could hang the longest.
One of the boys had suspended himself from a
tree when the attention of his mates was attracted
by the appearance on the scene of a three-legged
hare (the devil), which came limping past. The
lads tried to catch him, and in their eager pursuit
forgot the critical position of their companion, and
on their return found him dead. The gallows
is believed by many to have been erected in remembrance
of this event.</p>

<p>The story has no foundation in fact. A hare
crossing is regarded not only in Lincolnshire, and
other parts of England, but in many countries of
the world, as indicating trouble to follow.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

THE GALLOWS AT MELTON ROSS.</div>

<p>In the days of old two notable men held lands
in the district, Robert Tyrwhitt of Kettleby and
Sir William Ross of Melton, and between them
was a deadly feud, the outcome, in 1411, of a
slight and obscure question on manorial rights.
It was alleged that John Rate, steward of Sir
William Ross, had trespassed on lands at Wrawby
belonging to Robert Tyrwhitt, digged and taken<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
away turves for firing, felled trees, and cut
down brushwood. The dispute was tried by Sir
William Gascoigne, but it would appear that this did
not altogether meet the requirements of Tyrwhitt.
He assembled his men in large numbers and a
fight took place with the retainers of Sir William
Ross. An action of this kind could not be
tolerated even in a lawless age, and the matter
was brought before parliament. After long
and careful consideration, it was decided that
Tyrwhitt was in the wrong, and in the most
abject manner he had to beg the pardon of
Sir William Ross, but we are told it was merely
"lip service."</p>

<p>The hatred of the two families was transmitted
from sire to son until the reign of James I., and
then it broke out in open warfare. A battle was
fought at Melton Ross between the followers of
Tyrwhitt and those of the Earl of Rutland, the
representative of the Ross family. In the struggle
several servants were slain, and the king adopted
stringent measures to prevent future bloodshed.
He directed, so says tradition, that a gallows be
erected at Melton Ross, and kept up for ever, and
that if any more deaths should result from the old
feud it should be regarded as murder, and those<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by whom the deadly deed was committed were
to be executed on the gallows.</p>

<p>We hear nothing more of the feud after the
gallows had been erected, the action of the king
being the means of settling a strife which had lasted
long and kept the district in turmoil.</p>

<p>The gallows is on the estate of the Earl of
Yarborough, and it has been renewed by him, and
according to popular belief he is obliged to prevent
it falling into decay.</p>

<h3>Gallows Customs.</h3>

<p>When criminals were carried to Tyburn for
execution, it was customary for the mournful procession
to stop at the Hospital of St. Giles in the
Fields, and there the malefactors were presented
with a glass of ale. After the hospital was
dissolved the custom was continued at a public-house
in the neighbourhood, and seldom did a
cart pass on the way to the gallows without the
culprits being refreshed with a parting draught.
Parton, in his "History of the Parish," published
in 1822, makes mention of a public-house bearing
the sign of "The Bowl," which stood between the
end of St. Giles's High Street, and Hog Lane.</p>

<p>Particulars are given by Pennant and other<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
writers of a similar custom being maintained at
York. It gave rise to the saying, that "The saddler
of Bawtry was hanged for leaving his liquor": had
he stopped, as was usual with other criminals, to
drink his bowl of ale, his reprieve, which was
actually on its way, would have arrived in time
to save his life.</p>

<p>Robert Dowe, a worthy citizen of London,
gave to the vicar and churchwardens of St.
Sepulchre's Church, London, fifty pounds, on the
understanding that through all futurity they should
cause to be tolled the big bell the night before the
execution of the condemned criminals in the prison
of Newgate. After tolling the bell, the sexton
came at midnight, and after ringing a hand-bell,
repeated the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All you that in the condemned hold do lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch all and pray; the hour is drawing near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you before the Almighty must appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Examine well yourselves: in time repent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you may not to eternal flames be sent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord above have mercy on your souls!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next morning, when the sad procession passed
the church on its way to Tyburn, a brief pause
was made at the gate of St. Sepulchre's Church,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and the clergyman said prayers for the unfortunate
criminals, and at the same time the passing-bell
tolled its mournful notes.</p>

<p>According to a notice in a recent book by the
Rev. A. G. B. Atkinson, Robert Dowe was a
merchant tailor, and a benefactor; he assisted
John Stow and others. Dowe was born 1522, and
died 1612.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Not a few of the highwaymen who ended their
careers at the gallows appear to have been
dandies. Swift gives us a picture of one in
"Clever Tom Clinch." He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"... While the rabble was bawling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode stately through Holborn to die of his calling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stopped at the George for a bottle of sack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promised to pay for it&mdash;when he came back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His waistcoat and stockings and breeches were white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cap had a new cherry ribbon to tie't:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maids at doors and the balconies ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried 'Lack-a-day! he's a proper young man!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On January 21st, 1670, was hanged Claude
Duval, a great favourite with the ladies. It is
said that ladies of quality, in masks and with
tears, witnessed his execution and that he lay in
more than royal state at Tangier Tavern, St.
Giles's. His epitaph in the centre aisle of St.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Paul's, Covent Garden, may be regarded as a
model for highwaymen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lies Du Vall: reader, if male thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look to thy purse; if female to thy heart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sixteen-string Jack, hanged on November 30th,
1774, was dressed in a "bright pea-green coat,
and displayed an immense nosegay."</p>

<p>Frequently rioting occurred at executions, and
unpopular criminals would be pelted with missiles,
and meet with other indications of disfavour, but
usually the sympathies of the populace were with
the culprit. Attempts at rescuing criminals
would sometimes be made, and soldiers had to be
present to ensure order. On the 19th August,
1763, it is stated in "The Annual Register," "A
terrible storm made such an impression on the
ignorant populace assembled to see a criminal
executed on Kennington Common, that the
sheriff was obliged to apply to the secretaries of
state for a military force to prevent a rescue, and
it was near eight o'clock in the evening before he
suffered."</p>

<p>Another practice appears to have been to carry
the body of an executed criminal to the doors of
those who had been the chief cause of the
criminal being brought to justice. We read in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"The Annual Register," for 1763. "As soon
as the execution of several criminals, condemned
at last sessions of the Old Bailey, was over at
Tyburn, the body of Cornelius Sanders, executed
for stealing about fifty pounds out of the house of
Mrs. White, in Lamb Street, Spitalfields, was
carried and laid before her door, where great
numbers of people assembling, they at last grew
so outrageous that a guard of soldiers was sent
for to stop their proceedings; notwithstanding
which, they forced open the door, pitched out all
the salmon-tubs, most of the household furniture,
piled them on a heap, and set fire to them, and,
to prevent the guards from extinguishing the
flames, pelted them off with stones, and would
not disperse till the whole was consumed." In
the same work for the following year another
instance is given. "The criminal," says the
record, "condemned for returning from transportation
at the sessions, and afterwards executed,
addressed himself to the populace at Tyburn, and
told them he could wish they would carry his
body and lay it at the door of Mr. Parker, a
butcher in the Minories, who, it seems, was the
principal evidence against him; which, being
accordingly done, the mob behaved so riotously<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
before the man's house, that it was no easy
matter to disperse them."</p>

<h3>Curiosities of the Gallows.</h3>

<p>Instances are not wanting of criminals being
driven in their own carriages to the place of
execution. The story of William Andrew Horne,
a Derbyshire squire, as given in the "Nottingham
Date Book," is one of the most revolting records
of villainy that has come under our notice. His
long career of crime closed on his seventy-fourth
birthday, in 1759, at the gallows, Nottingham.
He had committed more than one murder, but
was tried for the death of an illegitimate child of
which he was the father. His brother laid the
information which at last brought him to justice.
This brother requested him to give him a small
sum of money so that he might leave the country,
but he refused to comply. He then said he should
make known his crime, but that did not frighten
Horne. He replied, "I'll chance it," and this gave
rise to a well-known saying in the Midlands, "I'll
chance it as Horne did his neck." He was
hanged at Gallows-Hill, Nottingham, and was
driven in his carriage by his own coachman. We
are told as the gloomy procession ascended the
Mansfield Road the white locks of the hoary<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sinner streamed mournfully in the wind, his head
being uncovered and the vehicle open, and the day
very tempestuous. He met his doom with a considerable
degree of fortitude, in the presence of an
immense crowd of spectators, including hundreds
of his Derbyshire neighbours and tenantry.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A year later Earl Ferrers was hanged for the
shooting of his own steward. On May 5th, 1760,
he was driven from the Tower to Tyburn in
a landau drawn by six horses. His lordship was
attired in his wedding clothes, which were of a
light colour and richly embroidered in silver. He
was hanged with a silken rope, and instead of
being swung into eternity from a common cart, a
scaffold was erected under the gallows, which
we think may be regarded as the precursor of the
drop. Mr. T. Broadbent Trowsdale contributed
to "Bygone Leicestershire" an informing paper
on "Laurence Ferrers: the Murderer-Earl."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
We reproduce an illustration of the execution
from a print of the period.</p>

<p>Some interesting details occur in <i>Notes and
Queries</i> for May 28th, 1898, respecting "The
Colleen Bawn." It is stated that when John<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Scanlan had been found guilty of the murder of
Ellen Hanley, the gentry of the county of Limerick
petitioned for a reprieve, which was refused.
They next requested that Scanlan be hanged with
a silken cord, though whether for its greater
dignity or because it offered a possibility of more
rapid strangulation in short drop, we cannot tell.
The Lord Lieutenant thought hemp would serve
the purpose. According to Haydn's "Dictionary
of Dates," Scanlan was executed 14th March, 1820.</p>

EXECUTION OF EARL FERRERS AT TYBURN.<br />
(<i>From a print of the period.</i>)</div>

<p>Mr. Gordon Fraser, of Wigtown, has collected
much interesting local lore respecting the town,
which was made a royal burgh in 1341. In bygone
times it had the distinction of having its own public
executioner. According to traditional accounts he
held office on somewhat peculiar conditions. The
law was, we are told, that this functionary was
himself to be a criminal under sentence of death, but
whose doom was to be deferred until the advance
of age prevented a continuance of his usefulness,
and then he was to be hanged forthwith. If, it
was said, the town permitted the executioner to
die by the ordinary decay of nature, and not by
the process of the cord, it would lose for ever the
distinguished honour of possessing a public hangman.
The story of the last official who held the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
tenure of his life upon being able to efficiently
despatch his fellows is sufficiently interesting. He
was taken ill, and it was seriously contemplated to
make sure of having a public hangman in the
future by seizing the sick man and hanging him.
His friends, hearing of this intention, propped the
dying Ketch up in bed, and he, being by trade a
shoemaker, had the tools and materials of his trade
placed before him. He made a pretence of plying
his avocation, and the townsmen, thinking his
lease of life was in no danger of a natural
termination, allowed him to lie in peace. He then
speedily passed away quietly in his bed, and the
outwitted burghers found themselves without a
hangman, and without hope of a successor.</p>

<p>A good story is told by Mr. Fraser of the last
man hanged at Wigtown. His name was Patrick
Clanachan, and he was tried and found guilty of
horse-stealing. His doom was thus pronounced:&mdash;"That
he be taken on the 31st August, 1709,
between the hours of twelve and two in the
afternoon, to the gyppet at Wigtown, and there
to hang till he was dead." Clanachan was carried
from the prison to the gallows on a hurdle, and,
as the people were hurrying on past him to witness
his execution, he is said to have remarked, "Tak'<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
yer time, boys, there'll be nae fun till I gang."
We have heard a similar anecdote respecting a
criminal in London.</p>

<p>At Wicklow, in the year 1738, a man named
George Manley was hanged for murder, and just
before his execution he delivered an address to
the crowd, as follows: "My friends, you
assemble to see&mdash;what? A man leap into the
abyss of death! Look, and you will see me go
with as much courage as Curtius, when he leaped
into the gulf to save his country from destruction.
What will you say of me? You say that no man,
without virtue, can be courageous! You see what
I am&mdash;I'm a little fellow. What is the difference
between running into a poor man's debt, and by
the power of gold, or any other privilege, prevent
him from obtaining his right, and clapping a pistol
to a man's breast, and taking from him his purse?
Yet the one shall thereby obtain a coach, and
honour, and titles; the other, what?&mdash;a cart and a
rope. Don't imagine from all this that I am
hardened. I acknowledge the just judgment of
God has overtaken me. My Redeemer knows
that murder was far from my heart, and what I did
was through rage and passion, being provoked by
the deceased. Take warning, my comrades; think<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
what would I now give that I had lived another
life. Courageous? You'll say I've killed a man.
Marlborough killed his thousands, and Alexander
his millions. Marlborough and Alexander, and
many others, who have done the like, are famous
in history for great men. Aye&mdash;that's the case&mdash;one
solitary man. I'm a little murderer and
must be hanged. Marlborough and Alexander
plundered countries; they were great men. I
ran in debt with the ale-wife. I must be hanged.
How many men were lost in Italy, and upon the
Rhine, during the last war for settling a king in
Poland. Both sides could not be in the right!
They are great men; but I killed a solitary man."</p>

<p>It will be seen from the following account, that
in the olden time the cost and trouble attending
an execution was a serious matter:&mdash;</p>

<p>Feasting at funerals in past time was by no
means uncommon in Great Britain, and perhaps
still lingers in some of the remoter parts of the
country. In Scotland until the commencement of
the present century before or after executions, civic
feasts were often held. After every execution,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
at Paisley, says the Rev. Charles Rogers,
<span class="smcapl">LL.D.</span>, the authorities had a municipal dinner.
Thomas Potts was hanged at Paisley, 1797, at a
cost to the town of &pound;33 5s. 3&frac12;d., of which the
sum of &pound;13 8s. 10d. was expended on a civic
feast, and &pound;1 14s. 3d. on the entertainment of the
executioner and his assistants. At Edinburgh, the
evening prior to an execution, the magistrates met
at Paxton's Tavern, in the Exchange, and made
their arrangements over liquor. These gatherings
were known as "splicing the rope."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>During the distress which, owing to the scanty
harvests of the later years of the last century,
prevailed throughout the country, but more
especially in the north, attention was drawn to an
extremely curious privilege claimed by the public
executioner of Dumfries. From old times a considerable
portion of the remuneration for his
hanging services was in kind, and levied in the
following manner. When the farmers and others
had set out in the public market their produce of
meal, potatoes, and similar provender, the hangman,
walking along the row of sacks, thrust into
each a large iron ladle, and put the result of each
"dip" into his own sack. This tax, from the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
odious occupation of the collector, was regarded
by the farmers and factors with particular
abhorrence, and numerous attempts were made at
different periods to put a stop to the grievous
exaction, but the progress of public opinion was
so little advanced, and the regard for the ancient
trammels of feudal arbitrariness so deep-seated,
that not until 1781 was any serious resistance
made. In that year a person named Johnston
stood upon what he considered his rights, and
would allow no acquaintance to be made between
his meal and the iron ladle of the Dumfries hangman.
The latter, seeing in this the subversion of
every fundamental principle of social order, to say
nothing of the loss threatened to his means of
subsistence, carried his complaint to the magistrates.
Consequently the Dumfries Hampden
was forthwith haled to prison. He was not, however,
long detained there, as his judges were made
aware by his threats of action for false imprisonment
that they were unaware of the position in which
they and the impost stood in the eyes of the law.
To remedy this ignorance, and be fore-armed for
other cases of resistance, which it was not unlikely
to suppose would follow, the Corporation of
Dumfries, in the year we have mentioned, had<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
recourse to legal advice. That they obtained
was of the highest standing, as they applied
to no less a personage than Andrew Crosbie, the
eminent advocate, who has been immortalised in
the Pleydell of "Guy Mannering." It will be
interesting to quote from the document laid before
him on this occasion, containing as it does several
particulars about the hangman of the town. One
part describes the office, duties, and pay of the
hangman, "who executes not only the sentences
pronounced by the magistrates of the burgh, and
of the King's judges on their circuits, but also the
sentences of the sheriff, and of the justices of the
peace at their quarter sessions. The town has
been in use to pay his house rent, and a salary
over and above. Roger Wilson, the present
executioner, has, since he was admitted, received
from the town &pound;6 of salary, and &pound;1 13s. 4d. for
a house rent. Over and above this salary and
rent, he and his predecessors have been in use of
levying and receiving weekly (to wit each market
day, being Wednesday,) the full of an iron ladle
out of each sack of meal, pease, beans, and
potatoes, and the same as to flounders." The
history of the impost is next very briefly dealt
with, the gist of the information on the subject<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
being that the tax had been levied from a period
beyond the memory of the "oldest people" without
quarrel or dispute. That the resistance of
Johnston was not an isolated instance we likewise
learn from this statement of the case, for it says
"there appears a fixed resolution and conspiracy
to resist and forcibly obstruct the levy of this usual
custom," and as the result of the tax according to
the executioner's own version amounted to more
than &pound;13 annually, it was of sufficient moment to
make sound advice desirable. The opinion of
Crosbie was that rights obtained by virtue of
office, and exercised from time out of mind, were
legal, and might very justly be enforced. While
commending the imprisonment of the dealer Johnston,
he suggested that the process of collection
should be made more formal than appears to have
been the case in this instance. Officers should
assist Jack Ketch in his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of tax-gatherer, and
all preventers should be formally tried by the
magistrates. The tax continued to be levied.
The farmers either gave up their meal grudgingly,
or, refusing, were sent to gaol. In 1796, when
the towns-people were in the utmost need of food,
riots and tumults arose in Dumfries, and as one
means of allaying the popular frenzy it was proposed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by the leading member of the Corporation,
Provost Haig, that the ladle's harvest should be
abolished, and his recommendation was immediately
put into effect. The hangman of
Dumfries was then one Joseph Tate, who was the
last of the officers of the noose connected officially
with Dumfries; for the loss of his perquisite he
was allowed the sum of &pound;2 yearly. It is satisfactory
to learn that the ladle itself, the only substantial
relic of this curious custom, is, in all probability preserved
at the present time. A footnote in W.
McDowall's valuable "History of Dumfries," says:
"The Dumfries hangman's ladle is still to be
seen we believe among other 'auld nick-nackets'
at Abbotsford." It was for many years lost sight
of, till in 1818, Mr. Joseph Train, the zealous
antiquary, hunted it out, and, all rusty as it was,
sent it as a present to Sir Walter Scott.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h3>Horrors of the Gallows.</h3>

<p>From the following paragraph, drawn from the
<i>Derby Mercury</i> of April 6th, 1738, we have a
striking example of how deplorable was the
conduct of the hangman in the olden time. It
is by no means a solitary instance of it being
mainly caused through drinking too freely:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"Hereford, March 25. This day Will Summers and
Tipping were executed here for house-breaking. At the tree,
the hangman was intoxicated with liquor, and supposing that
there were three for execution, was going to put one of
the ropes round the parson's neck, as he stood in the cart,
and was with much difficulty prevented by the gaoler from so
doing."</p></div>

<p>In bygone times, capital punishment formed an
important feature in the every-day life, and was
resorted to much more than it now is, for in those
"good old times" little regard was paid for human
life. People were executed for slight offences.
The painful story related by Charles Dickens, in
the preface to "Barnaby Rudge," is an example of
many which might be mentioned. It appears that
the husband of a young woman had been taken
from her by the press-gang, and that she, in a
time of sore distress, with a babe at her breast,
was caught stealing a shilling's worth of lace from
a shop in Ludgate Hill, London. The poor
woman was tried, found guilty of the offence, and
suffered death on the gallows.</p>

<p>We have copied from a memorial in the ancient
burial ground of St. Mary's Church, Bury St.
Edmunds, the following inscription which tells a
sad story of the low value placed on human life
at the close of the eighteenth century:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Hanging persons was almost a daily occurrence
in the earlier years of the present century, for
forging notes, passing forged notes, and other
crimes which we now almost regard with indifference.
George Cruikshank claimed with the aid of
his artistic skill to have been the means of putting
an end to hanging for minor offences. Cruikshank,
in a letter to his friend, Mr. Whitaker, furnishes
full details bearing on the subject. "About the
year 1817 or 1818," wrote Cruikshank, "there were
one-pound Bank of England notes in circulation,
and unfortunately there were forged one-pound
bank notes in circulation also; and the punishment
for passing these forged notes was in some cases
transportation for life, and in others <span class="smcapl">DEATH</span>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"At that time, I resided in Dorset Street,
Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, and had occasion
to go early one morning to a house near the
Bank of England; and in returning home between
eight or nine o'clock, down Ludgate Hill,
and seeing a number of persons looking up the
Old Bailey, I looked that way myself, and
saw several human
beings hanging on
the gibbet, opposite
Newgate prison,
and, to my horror,
two of them were
women; and upon
enquiring what the
women had been
hung for, was informed
that it was
for passing forged
one-pound notes. The fact that a poor woman
could be put to death for such a minor offence had
a great effect upon me, and I at once determined,
if possible, to put a stop to this shocking destruction
of life for merely obtaining a few shillings by
fraud; and well knowing the habits of the low
class of society in London, I felt quite sure that in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
very many cases the rascals who had forged the
notes induced these poor ignorant women to go
into the gin-shops to get 'something to drink,' and
thus <i>pass</i> the notes, and hand them the change.</p>

<p>"My residence was a short distance from
Ludgate Hill (Dorset Street); and after witnessing
the tragic-scene, I went home, and in ten
minutes designed and made a sketch of this
'<i>Bank-note not to be imitated</i>.' About half-an-hour
after this was done, William Hone came
into my room, and saw the sketch lying on my
table; he was much struck with it, and said,
'What are you going to do with this, George?'</p>

<p>"'To publish it,' I replied. Then he said,
'Will you let me have it?' To his request I consented,
made an etching of it, and it was
published. Mr. Hone then resided on Ludgate
Hill, not many yards from the spot where I had
seen the people hanging on the gibbet; and
when it appeared in his shop windows, it caused
a great sensation, and the people gathered round
his house in such numbers that the Lord Mayor
had to send the City police (of that day) to
disperse the <span class="smcapl">CROWD</span>. The Bank directors held a
meeting immediately upon the subject, and <span class="smcapl">AFTER
THAT</span> they issued <i>no more</i> one-pound notes, and so<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
there was <i>no more hanging for passing <span class="smcapl">FORGED</span>
one-pound notes</i>; not only that, but ultimately no
hanging even for forgery. <span class="smcap">After this</span> Sir Robert
Peel got a bill passed in Parliament for the
'Resumption of cash payments.' <span class="smcap">After this</span> he
revised the Penal Code, and <span class="smcapl">AFTER THAT</span> <i>there was
not any more hanging or punishment of <span class="smcapl">DEATH</span> for
minor offences</i>." We are enabled, by the
courtesy of Mr. Walter Hamilton, the author of
a favourably-known life of Cruikshank, to reproduce
a picture of the "Bank-note not to be
imitated." In concluding his letter to Mr.
Whitaker, Cruikshank said: "I consider it the
most important design and etching that I have
ever made in my life; for it has saved the life of
thousands of my fellow-creatures; and for having
been able to do this Christian act, I am, indeed,
most sincerely thankful."</p>

<p>At Nottingham in the olden time the culprits
were usually taken to St. Mary's Church, where
the officiating clergyman preached their funeral
sermon. Next they would inspect their graves,
and sometimes even test their capabilities by
seeing if they were large enough to hold their
remains. Frequently they would put on their
shrouds, and in various ways try to show that<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
they were indifferent to their impending fate.
Then they would be conveyed on a cart also
containing their coffin to the place of execution
some distance from the prison.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Similar usages
prevailed in other places.</p>

<p>Public executions always brought together a
large gathering of men and women, not always of
the lowest order, indeed many wealthy people
attended. "The last person publicly executed at
Northampton," says Mr. Christopher A. Markham,
<span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, "was Elizabeth Pinckhard, who was found
guilty of murdering her mother-in-law, and who
was sentenced to death by Sir John Jervis, on the
27th February, 1852. As a rule all executions
had taken place on a Monday, so a rumour was
spread that the execution would take place on
Monday, the 15th of March; accordingly the
people came together in their thousands. They
were, however, all disappointed; some of them
said they wished they had the under-sheriff and
they would let him know what it was to keep
honest people in suspense; and one old lady said
seriously that she should claim her expenses from
the sheriff. However, on Tuesday, the 16th
March, Mrs. Pinckhard was executed before an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
immense number of persons, estimated at ten
thousand, the day fixed having by some means or
other got known."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The conduct of the crowds
which gathered before Newgate and other prisons
was long a blot on the boasted civilisation of this
country, and there can be little doubt that public
executions had a baneful influence on the public.</p>

<p>It will not be without historical interest to
state that the last execution for attempted
murder was Martin Doyle, hanged at Chester,
August 27th, 1861. By the Criminal Law
Consolidation Act, passed 1861, death was
confined to treason and wilful murder. The Act
was passed before Doyle was put on trial, but
(unfortunately for him) did not take effect until
November 1st, 1861. Michael Barrett, author
of the Fenian explosion at Clerkenwell, hanged
at Newgate, May 26th, 1868, was the last person
publicly executed in England. Thomas Wells
(murderer of Mr. Walsh, station-master at
Dover), hanged at Maidstone, August 13th,
1868, was the first person to be executed within
a prison.</p>

<h2>Hanging in Chains.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> time is not so far distant when the
gibbet and gallows were common objects
in this country. In old road books, prepared for
the guidance of travellers, they are frequently
referred to as road marks. Several editions of
Ogilby's "Itinirarium Angli&aelig;" were published
between 1673 and 1717, and a few passages
drawn from this work relating to various parts of
England show how frequently these gruesome
instruments of death occur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"By the Gallows and Three Windmills enter the suburbs of
York."</p>

<p>"Leaving the forementioned suburbs [Durham], a small
ascent passing between the gallows and Crokehill."</p>

<p>"You pass through Hare Street, etc., and at 13'4 part of
Epping Forest, with a gallows to the left."</p>

<p>"You pass Pen-meris Hall, and at 250'4 Hilldraught Mill,
both on the left, and ascend a small hill with a gibbet on the
right."</p>

<p>"At the end of the city [Wells] you cross a brook, and pass
by the gallows."</p>

<p>"You leave Frampton, Wilberton, and Sherbeck, all on the
right, and by a gibbet on the left, over a stone bridge."</p>

<p>"Leaving Nottingham you ascend a hill, and pass by a
gallows."</p></div><p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Pictures found a prominent place in Ogilby's
pages, and we reproduce one of Nottingham.</p>

<p>It will be noticed
that the gallows
is shown a short
distance from the
town.</p>

<p>It is twenty-six
miles from London
to East Grinstead,
and in that short
distance were three
of these hideous instruments
of death
on the highway, in
addition to gibbets
erected in lonely
bylanes and secluded
spots where
crimes had been
committed. "Hangman's
Lanes" were
by no means uncommon. He was
a brave man who ventured alone at night on the
highways and byways when the country was beset<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with highwaymen, and the gruesome gibbets were
frequently in sight.</p>

ANGLO-SAXON GALLOWS.</div>

<p>Hanging was the usual mode of capital
punishment with the Anglo-Saxons. We give a
representation of a gallows (<i>gala</i>) of this period
taken from the illuminations to Alfric's version of
Genesis. It is highly probable that in some
instances the bodies would
remain <i>in terrorem</i> upon the
gibbet. Robert of Gloucester,
<i>circa</i> 1280, referring
to his own times, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">"In gibet hii were an honge."</div>

<p>"The habit of gibbeting
or hanging in chains the
body of the executed criminal
near the site of the
crime," says Dr. Cox, "with
the intention of thereby deterring
others from capital offences, was a coarse
custom very generally prevalent in medi&aelig;val
England. Some early assize rolls of the fourteenth
century pertaining to Derbyshire that we
have consulted give abundant proof of its being
a usual habit in the county at that period. In
1341 the bodies of three men were hung in chains<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
just outside Chapel-en-le-Frith, who had been
executed for robbery with violence. In the same
year a woman and two men were gibbeted on
Ashover Moor for murdering one of the King's
purveyors."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>An early record of hanging in chains is given in
Chauncy's "History of Hertfordshire." It states,
"Soon after the King came to Easthampstead, to
recreate himself with hunting, where he heard that
the bodies hanged here were taken down from
the gallowes, and removed a great way from the
same; this so incensed the King that he sent a
writ, tested the 3rd day of August, Anno 1381, to
the bailiffs of this borough, commanding them
upon sight thereof, to cause chains to be made,
and to hang the bodies in them upon the same
gallowes, there to remain so long as one piece
might stick to another, according to the judgment;
but the townsmen, not daring to disobey the
King's command, hanged the dead bodies of their
neighbours again to their great shame and reproach,
when they could not get any other for any wages
to come near the stinking carcases, but they themselves
were compelled to do so vile an office."
Gower, a contemporary poet, writes as follows:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And so after by the Lawe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was unto the gibbet drawe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he above all other hongeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to a traitor it belongeth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Robert Constable was gibbeted above the
Beverley-gate, Hull, in 1537, for high treason.
"On Fridaye," wrote the Duke of Norfolk,
"beying market daye at Hull, suffered and dothe
hange above the highest gate of the toune so
trymmed in cheynes that I thinke his boones woll
hang there this hundrethe yere."</p>

<p>According to Lord Dreghorn, writing in 1774:&mdash;"The
first instance of hanging in chains is in
March, 1637, in the case of Macgregor, for theft,
robbery, and slaughter; he was sentenced to be
hanged in a chenzie on the gallow-tree till his
corpse rot."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Philip Stanfield, in 1688, was hung in chains
between Leith and Edinburgh for the murder of
his father, Sir James Stanfield. In books relating
to Scotland, Stanfield's sad story has often been
told, and it is detailed at some length in Chambers's
"Domestic Annals of Scotland."</p>

<p>Hanging in chains was by no means rare from
an early period in the annals of England, but<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
according to Blackstone this was no part of the
legal judgment. It was not until 1752, by an Act
of 25 George II., that gibbeting was legally recognised.
After execution by this statute, bodies
were to be given to the surgeons to be dissected
and anatomized, and not to be buried without this
being done. The judge might direct the body to
be hung in chains by giving a special order to the
sheriff. This Act made matters clear, and was the
means of gibbeting rapidly increasing in this
country.</p>

<p>A gravestone in the churchyard of Merrington,
in the county of Durham, states:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">Here lies the bodies of<br />
John, Jane, and Elizabeth, children of John and Margaret Brass,<br />
Who were murdered the 28th day of January, 1683,<br />
By Andrew Mills, their father's servant,<br />
For which he was executed and hung in chains.<br />

Restored by subscription in 1789.</div>

<p>The parents of the murdered children were
away from home when the awful crime was committed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
by their farm servant, a young man aged
about nineteen, inoffensive, but of somewhat
deficient intellect. It is quite clear from the facts
which have come down to us that he was insane,
for in his confession he stated the devil suggested
the deed to his mind, saying, "Kill all, kill all,
kill all." The eldest of the family, a daughter,
struggled with him for some time, and he was not
able to murder her until after her arm was broken.
She had placed it as a bolt to a door to secure
the safety of the younger members of the family
who were sleeping in an inner room. The full
particulars of the horrible crime may be found in
the pages of Dodd's "History of Spennymoor,"
published in 1897, and are too painful to give in
detail. Some troopers marching from Darlington
to Durham seized the culprit, and conveyed him
with them. He was tried at Durham, and condemned
to be gibbeted near the scene of the
murders. Many stories which are related in the
district are, we doubt not without foundation in
fact. It is asserted that the wretch was gibbeted
alive, that he lived for several days, and that his
sweetheart kept him alive with milk. Another
tale is to the effect that a loaf of bread was placed
just within his reach, but fixed on an iron spike<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that would enter his throat if he attempted to
relieve the pangs of hunger with it.</p>

<p>His cries of pain were terrible, and might be
heard for miles. The country folk left their
homes until after his death. "It is to be hoped,"
says Mr. Dodd, the local historian, "that the
statement about the man being gibbeted alive is a
fiction." Some years ago, a local playwright
dramatised the story for the Spennymoor theatre,
where it drew large audiences.</p>

<p>Long after the body had been removed, a
portion of the gibbet remained, and was known
as "Andrew Mills's Stob," but it was taken away
bit by bit as it was regarded a charm for curing
toothache.</p>

<p>Robert and William Bolas were gibbeted on
Uckington Heath, near Shrewsbury, in 1723.
They had murdered Walter Matthews and
William Whitcomb, who had resisted their
entering a barn to steal wheat. A popular
saying in Shropshire is "Cold and chilly like old
Bolas." Its origin is referred back to the time the
body of Robert Bolas was hanging in chains. At
a public-house not far distant from the place one
dark night a bet was made that one of the party
assembled dare not proceed alone to the gibbet<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and ask after the state of Bolas's health. The
wager was accepted, and we are told the man
undertaking it at once made his way to the spot.
Immediately upon this, another of the company,
by a short cut, proceeded to the gibbet, and placed
himself behind it, and a third, carrying a number
of chains, concealed himself in a hedge adjoining
the road. Upon arriving at the gibbet, the person
undertaking to make the enquiry, screwed up his
courage, and timidly said in a low voice, "Well,
Bolas, how are you?" Immediately, in a shaky
voice, as from a tomb, came the response from
the person behind the gibbet, "Cold and chilly,
thank you." This unlooked-for reply completely
upset the valour of the enquirer, and turning tail
he fled for the inn with all possible speed. Upon
passing the place where the person with the
chains was lying, he was followed with a loud
rattling and reached his comrades in a most
exhausted and frightened condition. Tradition
has it that the event terminated in the bold
adventurer becoming, and continuing ever afterwards,
a lunatic.</p>

<p>When Robert Bolas was awaiting his trial he
believed that it would result in an acquittal, and
that he would thus be permitted to go home for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the corn harvest and get his barley. He was a
man of immense strength, and a great source of
amusement to his fellow prisoners awaiting trial,
before whom, although loaded with heavy chains,
he would sing and dance with the most perfect
ease. It was upon one of these occasions, when
he was in a particularly happy and hopeful mood,
that he is reported to have made use of the
saying, which is known even to the present day,
"I would that these troublesome times were over
as I want to go home and get my barley."</p>

<p>A curious story is told to the effect that the
corpse of Bolas was taken down from the gibbet
by some of his companions and thrown into the
river Tern, but that it would not sink. Weights
were then tied to it, but still it floated upon the
top of the water, and subsequently was again
placed upon the gibbet. The part of the river
into which it was thrown is still called "Bolas's
hole."</p>

BREEDS'S GIBBET-IRONS, RYE.</div>

<p>In the Town Hall, Rye, Sussex, is preserved
the ironwork used in 1742 for gibbeting John
Breeds, a butcher, who murdered Allen Grebble,
the Mayor of Rye. It appears that Breeds had a
dispute about some property with Thomas Lamb,
and learning that he was about to see a friend off<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by a ship sailing to France on the night of March
17th planned his murder. Mr. Lamb, for reasons
not stated, changed his mind, and induced his
neighbour Mr. Grebble to take his place. On
returning home and passing
the churchyard, Breeds rushed
upon him and mortally wounded
him with a knife. The unfortunate
man was able to walk
home, but shortly expired while
seated in his chair. His servant
was suspected of murdering
him, but Breeds's strange conduct
soon brought the crime
home to him. He was tried,
found guilty, and condemned
to death, and to be hung in
chains. The gibbet was set
up on a marsh situated at the
west end of the town, now
known as "Gibbet Marsh."
Here it stood for many years;
but when all the mortal remains had dropped

<p>Mr. Lewis Evans, has given, in his article on
"Witchcraft in Hertfordshire," an account of the
murder of John and Ruth Osborn, suspected of
witchcraft. Notice had been given at various
market towns in the neighbourhood of Tring that
on a certain day the man and his wife would be
ducked at Long Marston, in Tring Parish. On
the appointed day, April 22nd, 1757, says Mr.
Evans, Ruth Osborn, and her husband John,
sought sanctuary in the church, but the "bigotted
and superstitious rioters," who had assembled in
crowds from the whole district round, not finding
their victims, smashed the workhouse windows
and half destroyed it, caught its governor, and
threatened to burn both him and the town, and
searched the whole premises, even to the "salt
box," for the reputed witches in vain. However,
they were found at last, dragged from the vestry,
and their thumbs and toes having been tied
together, they were wrapped in sheets, and
dragged by ropes through a pond; the woman
was tried first, and as she did not sink, Thomas
Colley, a chimney sweep, turned her over and
over with a stick. John Osborn, the husband,
was then tested in the same way, and the trial
was made three times on each of them, with such<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
success, that the woman died on the spot, and the
man a few days later. When the experiment was
over, Colley went round and collected money
from the crowd for his trouble in shewing them
such sport.</p>

<p>The coroner's verdict, however, declared that
the Osborns had been murdered, and Colley was
tried at Hertford Assizes, before Sir William
Lee, and having been found guilty of murder,
was sent back to the scene of the crime under a
large escort of one hundred and eight men, seven
officers, and two trumpeters, and was hung on
August 24th, 1751, at Gubblecote Cross, where
his body swung in chains for many years.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A Salford woolcomber named John Grinrod (or
Grinret), poisoned his wife and two children in
September, 1758, and in the following March was
hanged and gibbeted for committing the crime.
The gibbet stood on Pendleton Moor. It was a
popular belief in the neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That the wretch in his chains, each night took the pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come down from the gibbet&mdash;and walk."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As can be easily surmised, such a story
frightened many of the simple country folk. It
was told to a traveller staying at an hostelry<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
situated not far distant from where the murderer's
remains hung in chains. He laughed to scorn
the strange stories which alarmed the countryside,
and laid a wager with the publican that he
would visit at midnight the gibbet. The traveller
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To the gibbet I'll go, and this I will do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As sure as I stand in my shoes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some address I'll devise, and if Grinny replies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My wager of course, I shall lose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are next told how, in the dark and dismal
night, the traveller proceeded without dismay to
the gibbet, and stood under it. Says Ainsworth,
the Lancashire novelist and poet, from whom we
are quoting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 26em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though dark as could be, yet he thought he could see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The skeleton hanging on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gibbet it creaked; and the rusty chains squeaked;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a screech-owl flew solemnly by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The heavy rain pattered, the hollow bones clattered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The traveller's teeth chattered&mdash;with cold&mdash;not with fright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind it blew hastily, piercingly, gustily;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Certainly not an agreeable night!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ho! Grindrod, old fellow,' thus loudly did bellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The traveller mellow&mdash;'How are ye, my blade?'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I'm cold and I'm dreary; I'm wet and I'm weary;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soon I'll be near ye!' the skeleton said.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The grisly bones rattled, and with the chains battled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gibbet appallingly shook;<br /></span>
<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><span class="i0">On the ground something stirr'd, but no more the man heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To his heels, on the instant, he took.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Over moorland he dashed, and through quagmire he plashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His pace never daring to slack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the hostel he neared, for greatly he feared<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Grindrod would leap on his back.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His wager he lost, and a trifle it cost;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But that which annoyed him the most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to find out too late, that certain as fate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The landlord had acted the Ghost."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tragic story of Eugene Aram has received
attention at the hands of the historian, poet, and
novelist, and his name is the most notable in
the annals of crime in the North of England.
In the winter of 1744-5 a shoemaker, named
Daniel Clarke, who had recently married, and was
possessed of money and other valuables, as it
subsequently transpired not obtained in an honourable
manner, was suddenly missing, and two of
his associates, Richard Houseman and Eugene
Aram, were suspected of knowing about his disappearance,
and even at their hands foul play was
suspected, but it could not be brought home to
them. Aram left the town, and in various places
followed his calling&mdash;that of a school teacher.
The mystery of Daniel Clarke remained for some
years unsolved, but in 1758 a labourer found at
Knaresborough some human bones, and it was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
suspected that they were Clarke's, and were shown
to Houseman, who was supposed to have a knowledge
of the missing man, and in an unguarded
moment said that they were not those of Clarke.
His manner aroused suspicion, and on being
pressed he confessed that Clarke was murdered
and buried in St. Robert's Cave, and that Aram
and himself were responsible for his death.
The cave was explored, and the skeleton of the
murdered man was found. Aram was arrested at
Lynn, where he was an usher in a school, and
was esteemed alike by pupils and parents. He
stoutly protested his innocence, and undertook his
own defence. He read it in court, and it was
regarded as a masterpiece of reasoning. It was,
however, made clear from the statements of
Houseman, who was admitted as king's evidence,
that Aram had murdered Clarke for gain when he
was in indigent circumstances. The jury returned
a verdict of guilty against Aram, and he was
condemned to death, and his body to be afterwards
hung in chains.</p>

<p>It appears quite clear from a careful consideration
of the case that Aram was guilty of the
crime.</p>

<p>He attempted, after his trial, to commit suicide<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by cutting his arm with a razor in two places, but
when discovered, with proper remedies, his failing
strength was restored. On the table was found a
document giving his reasons for attempting to end
his own life. On the morning of his execution he
stated that he awoke about three o'clock, and then
wrote the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, pleasing rest, eternal slumber fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seal mine, that once must seal the eyes of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm and composed, my soul her journey takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No guilt that troubles, and no heart that aches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu! thou sun, all bright like her arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu! fair friends, and all that's good and wise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On August 6th, 1759, he was hanged at York,
and afterwards his body was conveyed to Knaresborough
Forest, where it was gibbeted.</p>

<p>Hornsea people are sometimes called "Hornsea
Pennels," after a notorious pirate and smuggler,
named Pennel, who murdered his captain and sunk
his ship near to the place. He was tried and
executed in London for the crimes, and his body,
bound round with iron hoops, was sent to Hornsea,
in a case marked "glass." The corpse, in 1770,
was hung in chains on the north cliff. Long ago
the cliff with its gibbet has been washed away
by the sea.</p>

<p>On the night of June 8th, 1773, a man named<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Corbet, a rat-catcher and chimney-sweep, living
at Tring, entered down the chimney the house of
Richard Holt, of Bierton, Buckinghamshire, and
murdered him in his bed-chamber. For this
crime Corbet was hanged and gibbeted in a field
not far distant from the house where the murder
was committed. The gibbet served as a gallows.
A correspondent of the <i>Bucks Herald</i> says in
1795 he visited Bierton Feast, and at that period
the gibbet was standing, with the skull of the
murderer attached to the irons. Some years
later the irons were worn away by the action
of the swivel from which they were suspended,
fell, and were thrown into the ditch, and lost
sight of. Francis Neale, of Aylesbury, blacksmith,
made the gibbet, or as he calls it in his
account the gib, and his bill included entries as
follow:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">These figures were copied from the original
accounts by the late Robert Gibbs, the painstaking
local chronicler of Aylesbury. This is<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
understood to have been the last gibbet erected
in Buckinghamshire.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Terror and indignation were felt by the inhabitants
of the quiet midland town of Derby on
Christmas day, in the year 1775, as the news
spread through the place that on the previous
evening an aged lady had been murdered and her
house plundered. An Irishman named Matthew
Cocklain disappeared from the town, and he was
suspected of committing the foul deed. He was
tracked to his native country, arrested, and
brought back to Derby. At the following March
Assizes, he was tried and found guilty of the
crime, sentenced to be hanged, and afterwards
gibbeted. His body was for some time suspended
in the summer sun and winter cold, an
object of fright to the people in the district.</p>

<p>Christmas eve had come round once more, and
at a tavern, near the gibbet, a few friends were
enjoying a pipe and glass around the cheerful burning
yule-log, when the conversation turned to the
murderer, and a wager was made that a certain
member of the company dare not venture near
the grim gibbet at that late hour of night. A
man agreed to go, and take with him a basin of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
broth and offer it to Matthew Cocklain. He proceeded
without delay, carrying on his shoulder a
ladder, and in his hand a bowl of hot broth. On
arriving at the foot of the gibbet, he mounted the
ladder, and put to Cocklain's mouth the basin,
saying, "Sup, Matthew," but to his great astonishment,
a hollow voice replied, "It's hot." He was
taken by surprise; but, equal to the occasion, and
at once said, "Blow it, blow it," subsequently throwing
the liquid into the face of the suspended body.</p>

<p>He returned to the cosy room of the hostelry to
receive the bet he had won. His mate, who had
been hid behind the gibbet-post, and had tried to
frighten him with his sepulchral speech, admitted
that the winner was a man of nerve, and richly
entitled to the wager.</p>

<p>It has been asserted by more than one local
chronicler that John Whitfield, of Coathill, a
notorious north country highwayman, about
1777, was gibbeted alive on Barrock, a hill a few
miles from Wetherell, near Carlisle. He kept the
countryside in a state of terror, and few would
venture out after nightfall for fear of encountering
him. He shot a man on horseback in open daylight;
a boy saw him commit the crime, and was
the means of his identification and conviction. It<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is the belief in the district that Whitfield was
gibbeted alive, and that he hung for several days
in agony, and that his cries were heartrending,
until a mail-coachman passing that way put him
out of his misery by shooting him.</p>

<p>On the night of July 3rd, 1779, John Spencer
murdered William Yeadon, keeper of the Scrooby
toll-bar, and his mother, Mary Yeadon. The
brutal crime was committed with a heavy hedge-stake.
The culprit was soon caught, and tried at
Nottingham. It transpired that the prisoner was
pressed for money, and that the murders were
committed to obtain it. He was found guilty,
and condemned to be executed at Nottingham,
and then his body was to be hung in chains near
Scrooby toll-bar. In his hand was placed the
hedge-stake with which he had committed the
murders. After the body had been suspended
a few weeks the body was shot through by the
sergeant of a band of soldiers passing that way
with a deserter. For the offence he was followed
and reported, tried by court-martial, and reduced
to the ranks. This disturbance of the body caused
its rapid decomposition, and the odour blown over
the neighbouring village was most offensive.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>Several instances of persons being gibbeted for
robbing the mails have come under our notice.
In the columns of the <i>Salisbury Journal</i> for
August 18th, 1783, it is stated:&mdash;"The sentence
of William Peare for robbing the mail near
Chippenham stands unreversed.... He will
be executed at Fisherton gallows, on Tuesday
morning, about 11 o'clock, and his body will then
be inclosed in a suit of chains, ingeniously made
by Mr. Wansborough and conveyed to Chippenham,
and affixed to a gibbet erected near the spot
where the robbery was committed." The allusion
to "unreversed" has reference to the common
practice of condemning people to death, and
shortly afterwards granting a pardon. The issue
of the paper for the following week records that:
"On Tuesday morning Peare was executed at
Fisherton gallows.... The remaining part
of the sentence was completed on Wednesday, by
hanging the body in Green Lane, near Chippenham,
where it now is; a dreadful memento to
youth, how they swerve from the paths of rectitude,
and transgress the laws of their country." The
body of Peare was not permitted to remain long
on the gibbet. We see it is stated in a paragraph
in the same newspaper under date of November<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
10th, 1783, that on the 30th of October at night,
the corpse was taken away, and it was supposed
that this was done by some of his Cricklade
friends.</p>

<p>Near the Devil's Punch Bowl, at Hind Head,
an upright stone records the murder of a sailor,
and the inscription it bears is as under:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq"><div class="center">ERECTED<br />

<p>The stone was removed from its original
position on the old Portsmouth road, which ran at
a higher level, and placed where it now stands
some years since.</p>

<p>The three men who committed the crime were
arrested at Rake, near Petersfield, and in their<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
possession was found the clothing of the unfortunate
sailor. They were tried at Kingston, and
found guilty of murder, and condemned to be
hanged and gibbeted near where they had
committed the foul deed. On April 7th, 1787,
the sentence was carried into effect. The gibbet
remained for three years, and was then blown
down in a gale. The hill is still known as Gibbet
Hill.</p>

<p>The murdered man was buried in Thursley
churchyard, and over his remains was erected a
gravestone, bearing a carving representing three
men killing the sailor, and an inscription as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On February 2nd, 1787, two dissolute young
men named Abraham Tull and William Hawkins,
aged respectively nineteen and seventeen, waylaid
and murdered William Billimore, an aged
labourer. They stole his silver watch, but were
too frightened to continue their search for money
which they expected to find, and made a hasty
retreat; but they were soon overtaken, and were
subsequently, at Reading Assizes, tried and condemned
to be gibbeted on Ufton Common within
sight of their homes. For many years their
ghastly remains were suspended to gibbet posts,
much to the terror and annoyance of the people
in the district. No attempt was made to remove
the bodies, on account of it being regarded as
unlawful, until Mrs. Brocas, of Beaurepaire, then
residing at Wokefield Park, gave private orders
for them to be taken down in the night and
buried, which was accordingly done. During her
daily drives she passed the gibbeted men and the
sight greatly distressed her, and caused her to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
have them taken down.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The ironwork of the
gibbets are in the Reading Museum.</p>

<p>William Lewin, in 1788, robbed the post-boy
carrying the letters from Warrington to Northwich,
between Stretton and Whitley. He managed to
elude the agents of the law for three years, but
was eventually captured, tried at Chester, and
found guilty of committing the then capital offence
of robbing the mail. He was hanged at Chester.
Says a contemporary account:&mdash;"His body is
hung in chains on the most elevated part of
Helsby Tor, about eight miles from Chester;
from whence it may be conspicuously seen, and,
by means of glasses, is visible to the whole
county, most parts of Lancashire, Flintshire,
Denbighshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire, etc., etc."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
About this period there were three gibbets along
the road between Warrington and Chester.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Only five months after William Lewin had been
gibbeted for robbing the mails, almost in the same
locality Edward Miles robbed and murdered the
post-boy carrying the Liverpool mail-bag to
Manchester on September 15th, 1791. For this
crime he was hanged, and suspended in chains<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the Manchester Road, near "The Twysters,"
where the murder had been committed. In 1845
the irons in which the body had been encased
were dug up near the site of the gibbet, and may
now be seen in the Warrington Museum. Our
illustration is reproduced from a drawing in
Mr. Madeley's work, "Some Obsolete Modes
of Punishment." It will be observed the irons
which enclosed the head are wanting.</p>

<p>Spence Broughton was tried at York, in 1792,
for robbing the mail running between Sheffield
and Rotherham. He was found guilty, and condemned
to be executed at York, and his body to
be hung in chains near the place where the robbery
had been committed. The gibbet-post (which
was the last put up in Yorkshire), with the irons,
the skull, and a few other bones and rags, was
standing in 1827-28, when it was taken down.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>We learn from "The Norfolk and Norwich
Remembrancer" (1822), that on May 2nd, 1804,
the gibbet on which Payne, the pirate, was hung
about 23 years previously, upon Yarmouth North
Denes, was taken down by order of the Corporation.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire history supplies some curious details<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
respecting the gibbeting of a man named Tom
Otter, in the year 1806. We are told that he
was compelled by the old poor law regulations to
wed a girl he had injured. He lured her into a
secluded spot the day after their marriage, and
deliberately murdered her. According to the
prevalent custom, Tom Otter's corpse was hung
in chains. The day selected for that purpose inaugurated
a week of merry-making of the most
unseemly character. Booths were pitched near
the gibbet, and great numbers of the people came
to see the wretch suspended. It is reported that
some years later, when the jaw bones had become
sufficiently bare to leave a cavity between them, a
bird built its nest in this unique position. The
discovery of nine young ones therein gave rise to
the following triplet still quoted in the neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There were nine tongues within the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tenth went out to seek some bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed the living in the dead."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The gibbet was standing until the year 1850,
when it was blown down.</p>

<p>At the Derby March Assizes, 1815, a young
man named Anthony Lingard was tried and
convicted for murdering Hannah Oliver, a widow,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
who kept the turnpike-gate at Wardlow Miers, in
the parish of Tideswell. The following account
of the crime is from the <i>Derby Mercury</i>, for
March 13th, 1815:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"On Saturday morning, Anthony Lingard, the younger,
aged 21, was put to the bar, charged with the murder (by
strangulation) of Hannah Oliver, a widow woman, aged 48
years, who kept the turnpike gate at Wardlow Miers, in the
parish of Tideswell, in this county.</p>

<p>"It appeared in evidence that the prisoner committed the
robbery and murder in the night of Sunday the 15th of
January last; that he took from the house several pounds
in cash and notes, and a pair of new woman's shoes; that
immediately after the deed was perpetrated, he went to a
young woman in the neighbourhood, who was pregnant by
him, and offered to give her some money with a view to
induce her to father the child upon some other person; that
he gave her the shoes, and also some money; but it being
rumoured that Hannah Oliver had been murdered, and that a
pair of shoes had been taken from her, the young woman
returned the shoes to the prisoner, who said she had no
occasion to be afraid, for that he had had them of a person in
exchange for a pair of stockings. The shoes, however, were
returned to him; and the evidence adduced in respect to them,
as well as in respect to a great variety of circumstances connected
with the horrid transaction, was given in such a very
minute detail of corroborative and satisfactory proofs, as to
leave no doubt in the minds of everyone that the prisoner was
the person who had committed the murder, independent of
his own confession, which was taken before the magistrates,
previous to his committal.</p>

<p>"The trial on the part of the prosecution being closed, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the prisoner not having any witness to call, the learned
judge carefully summed up the evidence to the jury, who
after a few minutes returned a verdict of guilty.</p>

<p>"His Lordship then passed the awful sentence of the law
upon the prisoner, which was done by the learned judge in the
most solemn and impressive manner, entreating him to make
the best use of his time, and to prepare himself during the
short period he had to live, for the great change he was about
to undergo.</p>

<p>"Since his condemnation he conducted himself with greater
sobriety than he had manifested before his trial; but his
temper was obstinate, and his mind lamentably ignorant: and
being totally unacquainted with religious considerations, he
exhibited very imperfect signs of real penitence, and but little
anxiety respecting his future state. He acknowledged the
crime for which he was about to suffer the sentence of the law,
but was reluctantly induced to pronounce his forgiveness of the
young woman who was the principal evidence against him.</p>

<p>"At 12 o'clock yesterday he was brought upon the drop in
front of the County gaol, and after a short time occupied in
prayer with the chaplain (who had previously attended him
with the most unremitting and tender assiduity), he was
launched into eternity. He met his fate with a firmness
which would deserve the praise of fortitude if it was not the
result of insensibility. He appeared but little agitated or
dejected by his dreadful situation.</p>

<p>"Let the hope be encouraged that his example may operate
as a warning to those among the multitude of spectators, who
might not before feel all the horror with which vice ought to
be regarded. When wickedness is thus seen not in its allurements,
but in its consequences, its true nature is evidenced.
It is always the offspring of ignorance and folly, and the parent
of long enduring misery.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before the Judge left the town, he directed that the body of
Lingard should be hung in chains in the most convenient
place near the spot where the murder was committed, instead
of being dissected and anatomized."</p></div>

<p>The treasurer's accounts for Derbyshire, for
1815-16, show, says Dr. Cox, that the punishment
of gibbeting involved a serious inroad on the
county finances. The expenses for apprehending
Anthony Lingard amounted to &pound;31 5s. 5d., but
the expenses incurred in the gibbeting reached a
total of &pound;85 4s. 1d., and this in addition to ten
guineas charged by the gaoler for conveying the
body from Derby to Wardlow.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A paragraph in Rhodes's "Peak Scenery," first
published in 1818, is worth reproducing:&mdash;"As
we passed along the road to Tideswell," writes
the author, "the villages of Wardlow and Litton
lay on our left.... Here, at a little distance on
the left of the road, we observed a man suspended
on a gibbet, which was but newly erected. The
vanity of the absurd idea of our forefathers, in
thinking that a repulsive object of this kind would
act as a deterrent of crime, was strikingly shown
in the case of this Wardlow gibbet." It is related
of Hannah Pecking, of Litton, who was hung on<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
March 22nd, 1819, at the early age of sixteen, for
poisoning Jane Grant, a young woman of the
same village, that she "gave the poison in a
sweet cake to her companion, as they were going
to fetch some cattle out of a field, near to which
stood the gibbet-post of Anthony Lingard."</p>

<p>The gibbet was taken down on April 10th,
1826, by order of the magistrates, and the remains
of Lingard buried on the spot. We give a
drawing of Lingard's gibbet-cap, which is now in
the museum at Belle Vue, Manchester.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Cox contributed to the columns
of <i>The Antiquary</i>, for November, 1890, some
important notes on this theme. "It was usual,"
says Dr. Cox, "to saturate the body with tar
before it was hung in chains, in order that it might
last the longer. This was done with the bodies of
three highwaymen about the middle of last century,
gibbeted on the top of the Chevin, near Belper,
in Derbyshire. They had robbed the North
Coach when it was changing horses at the inn at
Hazelwood, just below the summit of the Chevin.
After the bodies had been hanging there for a few
weeks, one of the friends of the criminals set fire
at night time to the big gibbet that bore all three.
The father of our aged informant, and two or<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
three others of the cottagers near by, seeing a
glare of light, went up the hill, and there they saw
the sickening spectacle of the three bodies blazing
away in the darkness. So thoroughly did the tar
aid this cremation that the next morning only the
links of the iron remained on the site of the
gibbet."</p>

LINGARD'S GIBBET-CAP.</div>

<p>On the high road near
Brigg, in 1827, a murder
was committed by a
chimney-sweep. At the
Lincoln Assizes he was
condemned to be hanged,
and hung in chains on the
spot where the tragedy
occurred. The inhabitants
of Brigg petitioned
against the gibbeting, as
it was so near the town,
and consequently that part
of the sentence was remitted.</p>

<p>A strike occurred at Jarrow Colliery, in 1832,
and Mr. Nicholas Fairles, one of the owners, was
a magistrate for the county of Durham, the only
one in the district, and he took an active part in
preserving peace during the troublesome time.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
He was seventy-one years of age, and greatly
esteemed for his kindly disposition and high moral
character. On June 11th he had been transacting
some business at the Colliery, and was riding
home to South Shields on his pony. When he had
reached a lonely place, two men attacked him,
dragging him from his horse, because he refused
to give them money. They then felled him to the
ground with a bludgeon, and as he lay helpless on
the ground, heavy stones were used to end his life.</p>

<p>He was left for dead, but on being found and
carried to a neighbouring house, it was discovered
that he was alive, and after a few hours he
recovered consciousness, and was able to give the
names of the two men who had attempted to
murder him, whom he knew, and who were Jarrow
colliers, William Jobling and Ralph Armstrong.
After lingering a few days, Mr. Fairles died.
Jobling was soon caught, but Armstrong escaped,
and was never brought to justice. Jobling was
tried at Durham Assizes, and condemned to be
hanged and gibbeted. On August 3rd he was
executed at Durham, and his body was subsequently
escorted by fifty soldiers and others to
Jarrow Slake, and set up on a gibbet 21 feet high.
The post was fixed into a stone, weighing about<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
thirty hundredweight, and sunk into the water a
hundred yards from the high-water mark, and
opposite the scene of the tragedy. The gruesome
spectacle was not permitted to remain, for on the
night of the 31st of the same month it was erected
it was taken down, it is supposed, by some of his
fellow workmen, and the body was quietly buried in
the south-west corner of Jarrow churchyard. It
only remains to be added that during the construction
of the Tyne Dock, the iron framework in
which Jobling's body was suspended was found,
and was in 1888 presented by the directors of the
North Eastern Railway Company to the Newcastle
Society of Antiquaries. On 14th April, 1891,
passed away at the advanced age of 96, Jobling's
widow, and it has been stated, with her death the
last personal link with the gibbet was severed.</p>

<p>The last man gibbeted in this country was
James Cook, a bookbinder, at Leicester. He
was executed for the murder of John Paas, a
London tradesman, with whom he did business.
Cook's body was suspended on a gibbet thirty-three
feet high, on Saturday, August 11th, 1832,
in Saffron Lane, Aylestone, near Leicester. The
body was soon taken down, and buried on the
spot where the gibbet stood, by order of the Secretary<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of State, to put a stop to the disturbances
caused by the crowds of people visiting the place
on a Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Some little time before the execution of a
criminal who was also condemned to be hung
in chains, it was customary for the blacksmith to
visit the prison and measure the victim for the
ironwork in which he was to be suspended.</p>

<h3>Hanging Alive in Chains.</h3>

<p>Nearly every district in England has its thrilling
tale of a man hanging alive in chains. Some
writers affirm the truth of the story, while others
regard it as merely fiction. We are not in a
position to settle the disputed question. Blackstone,
in his "Commentaries," published in 1769,
clearly states that a criminal was suspended in
chains after execution. Holinshed, who died
about the year 1580, in his famous "Chronicle
of England," a work which supplied Shakespeare
with materials for historical dramas, states:&mdash;"In
wilful murder done upon pretended (premeditated)
malice, or in anie notable robbery, the criminal is
either hanged alive in chains near the place
where the act was committed, or else, upon compassion<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
taken, first strangled with a rope, and
so continueth till his bones come to nothing.
Where wilful manslaughter is perpetrated, besides
hanging, the offender hath his right hand commonly
stricken off."</p>

<p>We glean an important item from "England's
Mourning Garment," written by Henry Chettle,
a poet and dramatist, born about the year 1540, and
who died in 1604. He lived in the days of Queen
Elizabeth. "But for herselfe," wrote Chettle,
"she was alwayes so inclined to equitie that if
she left Justice in any part, it was in shewing
pittie; as in one generall punishment of murder
it appeared; where-as before time there was
extraordinary torture, as hanging wilfull murderers
alive in chains; she having compassion like a true
Shepheardesse of their soules, though they were
often erring and utterly infected flock, said their
death satisfied for death; and life for life was all
that could be demanded; and affirming more,
that much torture distracted a dying man." This
subject is fully discussed in <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
4th series, volumes <span class="smcapl">X.</span> and <span class="smcapl">XI.</span> A work entitled
"Hanging in Chains," by Albert Hartshorne,
<span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, (London, 1891), contains much out-of-the-way
information on this theme.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Bewick, the famous artist and naturalist, in his
pictures of English scenery introduced the gibbet
"as one of the characteristics of the picturesque."</p>

<p>The old custom of hanging the bodies of
criminals in chains was abolished by statute on
July 25th, 1834, and thus ends a strange chapter
in the history of Old England.</p>

<h2>Hanging, Drawing, and Quartering.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Hanging</span>, drawing, and quartering, with
their attendant horrors, have been termed
"godly butchery," on account of the divine authority
which was adduced to support their continuance.
Lord Coke finds in the Bible a countenance
for each of the horrid details of the
punishment. We see that the texts supposed to
bear upon the subject are raked from all parts of
the Scriptures with great ingenuity, but with, in
our modern eyes, not much of either humanity or
probability of there being anything more than a
forced reference. The sentence on traitors was
pronounced as follows: "That the traitor is to be
taken from the prison and laid upon a sledge or
hurdle [in earlier days he was to be dragged along
the surface of the ground, tied to the tail of a
horse], and drawn to the gallows or place of
execution, and then hanged by the neck until he
be half dead, and then cut down; and his entrails
to be cut out of his body and burnt by the executioner;
then his head is to be cut off, his body to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
be divided into quarters, and afterwards his head
and quarters to be set up in some open places
directed." The headsman, or hangman, commonly
sliced open the chest and cut thence the
heart, plucking it forth and holding it up to the
populace, saying, "Behold the heart of a traitor."
The members were disposed on the gates of the
cities, and in London on London Bridge, or upon
Westminster Hall.</p>

<p>It is asserted that this mode of capital punishment
was first inflicted in 1241, on William
Marise, pirate, and the son of a nobleman.</p>

<p>For a long period this disgusting punishment
was the penalty for high treason. A late instance,
and the last in the provinces, occurred at Derby
in 1817. At this period distress prevailed to an
alarming extent in many parts of the country, but
no where was it more keenly felt than in the Midland
counties. At the instigation of paid government
spies, the poor, suffering people were urged
to overthrow the Parliament. The plot was
planned in a public house called the White Horse,
at Pentrich, Derbyshire. A few half-starved
labouring men took part in the rising, being
assured by the perjured spies that it would simultaneously
occur throughout the breadth and length<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the land, and that success must crown their
efforts. The deluded men had not advanced far
before they were scattered by the Yeomanry, and
the chief movers taken prisoners. It was the
object of the government to terrify the public and
cripple all attempts at obtaining reform. Four
judges were sent to Derby to try the poor peasants
for rebellion, and commenced their duties
on the 15th and ended them on October 25th.
Three of the ringleaders, Jeremiah Brandreth,
William Turner, and Isaac Ludlam, were found
guilty of high treason, and the capital sentence
passed upon them; the greater part of the other
prisoners were condemned to transportation.
Little time was lost in carrying out the sentence;
the death warrant for the execution was signed on
November 1st by the Prince Regent, and it remitted
only quartering, and directed that the three
men be hung, drawn, and beheaded. It appears
that the High Sheriff, after consultation with the
surgeon of the prison and other officials, proposed
taking off the heads of the unfortunate men with
a knife, and the operation to be performed by a
person skilled in anatomy. On this being
brought under the notice of the authorities in
London, it was, however, decided that the execution<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
should be carried out according to old
usage with the axe. Bamford, a blacksmith, of
Derby, was entrusted with an order for two axes,
to be made similar to the one used at the Tower.
They measured eight and a half inches across the
edge and were one foot long. On the morning
of November 7th, before execution, the three
men received Sacrament. The town blacksmith
knocked off the irons by which they were
loaded, and substituted others that were fitted
with locks, so that they might easily be removed.
A simply made hurdle was then brought in the
prison-yard, and on it they were pulled by a horse
to the gallows. It was so roughly constructed
that the poor fellows had to be held to keep them
on it. "On mounting the scaffold in front of the
gaol," says Dr. Cox, to whom we are indebted for
many details in this chapter, "Brandreth exclaimed,
'It is all Oliver and Castlereagh;' Turner,
following him, also called out, 'This is all Oliver
and the Government; the Lord have mercy on
my soul.' They hung from the gallows for half-an-hour.
On the platform, in front of the gallows,
was placed the block and two sacks of sawdust,
and on a bench two axes, two sharp knives, and a
basket. The block was a long piece of timber<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
supported at each end by pieces a foot high, and
having a small batten nailed across the upper end
for the neck to rest upon. The body of Brandreth
was first taken down from the gallows, and
placed face downwards on the block. The executioner,
a muscular Derbyshire coal miner,
selected by the sheriff for his proficiency in
wielding the pick, was masked, and his name kept
a profound secret. Brandreth's neck received
only one stroke, but it was not clean done, and
the assistant (also masked) finished it off with a
knife. Then the executioner laid hold of the
head by the hair, and holding it at arm's length,
to the left, to the right, and in front of the scaffold,
called out three times&mdash;'Behold the head of the
traitor, Jeremiah Brandreth.' The other two
were served in like manner. Turner's neck received
one blow and the knife had to be applied,
but Ludlam's head fell at once. The scaffold was
surrounded by a great force of cavalry with drawn
swords, and several companies of infantry were
also present. The space in front of the gaol was
densely packed with spectators."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> "When the
first stroke of the axe was heard," says an eye-witness,
"there was a burst of horror from the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
crowd, and the instant the head was exhibited,
there was a terrifying shriek set up, and the
multitude ran violently in all directions, as if
under the influence of a sudden frenzy."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The poet Shelley is said to have witnessed the
painful spectacle. On the previous day had passed
away in childbirth the Princess Charlotte. The
two circumstances formed the subject of an able
pamphlet, drawing a contrast between the deaths,
and furnishing a description of the scene within
and without the prison at Derby. "When
Edward Turner (one of those transported)," says
Shelley, "saw his brother dragged along upon
the hurdle, he shrieked horribly, and fell in a fit,
and was carried away like a corpse by two men.
How fearful must have been their agony sitting
in solitude that day when the tempestuous voice
of horror from the crowd told them that the head
so dear to them was severed from the body!
Yes, they listened to the maddening shriek which
burst from the multitude; they heard the rush of
ten thousand terror-stricken feet, the groans and
hootings which told them that the mangled and
distorted head was then lifted in the air." The
title of Shelley's pamphlet is "We pity the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Plumage, but forget the Dying Bird. An
Address to the People on the Death of the
Princess Charlotte. By the Hermit of Marlow."</p>

<p>On the same night the three executed men
were buried without any religious service in one
grave in the churchyard of St. Werburgh, Derby.</p>

<p>When Dr. Cox was preparing for the press his
"Three Centuries of Derbyshire Annals," he saw
the block on which these men were beheaded
and supplies a description of it as follows: "It
consists of two two and a half inch planks fastened
together; it is six feet six inches long by two feet
wide. Six inches from one end a piece of wood is
nailed across three inches high. The whole is
tarred over, but the old warder drew our attention
to the fact that, though the cell where it is kept is
very dry, the wood is still in places damp. It is a
gaol tradition that the blood of these unhappy men
shed in 1817 has never and will never dry."</p>

<p>On May 1st, 1820, the Cato Street Conspirators
were, after death by hanging, beheaded.
This is the latest instance of the ancient custom
being maintained in this country. In connection
with this subject we may perhaps be permitted
to draw attention to a chapter by us in "England
in the Days of Old" (1897), entitled "Rebel<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Heads on City Gates;" it includes much curious
information bearing on this theme.</p>

<p>We must not omit to state that the great agitator
against the continuance of the barbarities of
hanging, drawing and quartering was Sir Samuel
Romilly, who in the reign of George III., brought
upon himself the odium of the law-officers of the
Crown, who declared he was "breaking down the
bulwarks of the constitution." By his earnest
exertions, however, the punishment was carried
out in a manner more amenable to the dictates of
mercy and humanity.</p>

<h2>Pressing to Death.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">One</span> of the most barbarous and cruel of the
punishments of our English statutes was
that distinguished by the name of <i>Peine forte et
dure</i>, or pressing to death with every aggravation
of torture. It was adopted as a manner of punishment
suitable to cases where the accused refused
to plead, and was commuted about the year 1406
from the older method of merely starving the
prisoner to death. At that time the alteration
was considered to be decidedly according to the
dictates of humanity and mercy, as the sooner
relieving the accused from his sufferings. Such
was the small value set upon human life in those
dark days of British justice.</p>

<p>The manner in which this exceedingly great
torture was inflicted was as follows: "That the
prisoner shall be remanded to the place from
whence he came, and put in some low, dark room,
and there laid on his back, without any manner of
covering except a cloth round his middle; and
that as many weights shall be laid upon him as he
can bear, <i>and more</i>; and that he shall have no<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
more sustenance but of the worst bread and water,
and that he shall not eat the same day on which
he drinks, nor drink the same day on which he
eats; and he shall so continue till he die." At a
later period, the form of sentence was altered to
the following: "That the prisoner shall be remanded
to the place from whence he came, and
put in some low, dark room; that he shall lie
without any litter or anything under him, and that
one arm shall be drawn to one quarter of the room
with a cord, and the other to another, and that his
feet shall be used in the same manner, and that as
many weights shall be laid on him as he can bear,
and more. That he shall have three morsels of
barley bread a day, and that he shall have the
water next the prison, so that it be not current,
and that he shall not eat," etc. The object of
this protracted punishment was to allow the
victim, at almost every stage of the torture, to
plead, and thus allow the law to take its ordinary
course. The object of the persons who have
refused to plead was, that any person who died
under the <i>Peine forte et dure</i> could transmit his
estates to his children, or will them as he desired;
whereas, if he were found guilty, they would be
forfeited to the Crown. In connection with this,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it may be mentioned that when the practice of
pressing to death had become nearly extinct,
prisoners who declined to plead were tortured, in
order to compel them to do so, by twisting and
screwing their thumbs with whipcord.</p>

<p>In 1721, a woman named Mary Andrews was
subjected to this punishment. After bearing with
fortitude the first three whipcords, which broke
from the violence of the twisting, she submitted to
plead at the fourth.</p>

<p>Baron Carter, at the Cambridge Assizes, in
1741, ordered a prisoner, who refused to plead, to
have his thumbs twisted with cords, and when
that was without avail, inflicted the higher penalty
of pressing. Baron Thompson, about the same
time, at the Sussex Assizes, treated a prisoner in
a precisely similar manner.</p>

<p>A like method was pursued in 1721, with
Nathaniel Hawes, a prisoner who refused to
plead; when the cord proved inefficacious, a
weight of 250 pounds was laid upon him, after
which he decided to plead. The same year seems
prolific of cases of this character, there being
particulars of an instance in the <i>Nottingham
Mercury</i> of January 19th, 1721. They are
included in the London news, and are as follow:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
"Yesterday the sessions began at the Old Bailey,
where several persons were brought to the bar for
highway robbery, etc. Among them were the
highwaymen lately taken at Westminster, two of
whom, namely, Thomas Green, <i>alias</i> Phillips, and
Thomas Spiggot, refusing to plead, the court
proceeded to pass the following sentence upon
them: 'that the prisoner shall be,' etc. [the
usual form, as given above]. The former, on
sight of the terrible machine, desired to be
carried back to the sessions house, where he
pleaded not guilty. But the other, who behaved
himself very insolently to the ordinary who was
ordered to attend him, seemingly resolved to
undergo the torture. Accordingly, when they
brought cords, as usual, to tie him, he broke
them three several times like a twine-thread, and
told them if they brought cables he would serve
them after the same manner. But, however, they
found means to tie him to the ground, having his
limbs extended; but after, enduring the punishment
for an hour, and having three or four
hundredweight put on him, he at last submitted
to plead, and was carried back, when he pleaded
not guilty."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Willette, the ordinary of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
prison, in 1776, published the "Annals of Newgate,"
and from these we learn further particulars
of the torture of the highwayman, Thomas
Spiggot. "The chaplain found him lying in the
vault upon the bare ground, with 350 pounds
weight upon his breast, and then prayed with him,
and at several times asked him why he should
hazard his soul by such obstinate kind of self-murder.
But all the answer that he made was,
'Pray for me; pray for me.' He sometimes lay
silent under the pressure as if insensible to the
pain, and then again would fetch his breath very
quick and short. Several times he complained
that they had laid a cruel weight upon his face,
though it was covered with nothing but a thin
cloth, which was afterwards removed and laid
more light and hollow; yet he still complained of
the prodigious weight upon his face, which might
be caused by the blood being forced up thither
and pressing the veins so violently as if the force
had been externally on his face. When he had
remained for half-an-hour under this load, and
fifty pounds weight more laid on, being in all four
hundred, he told those who attended him he
would plead. The weights were at once taken
off, the cords cut asunder; he was raised up by two<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
men, some brandy put into his mouth to revive
him, and he was carried to take his trial." The
practice of <i>Peine forte et dure</i> gave the name
of "Press-yard" to a part of Newgate, and the
terrible machine above referred to was probably
in the form of a rack.</p>

<p>We require to go further back to find instances
of a fatal termination to the punishment. Such a
case occurred in 1676. One Major Strangeways
and his sister held in joint possession a farm, but
the lady becoming intimate with a lawyer named
Fussell, to whom the Major took a strong dislike,
he threatened that if she married the lawyer he
would, in his office or elsewhere, be the death of
him. Surely, Fussell was one day found shot
dead in his London apartments, and suspicion at
once fell upon the officer, and he was arrested.
At first he was willing to be subjected to the
ordeal of touch, but when placed upon trial,
resolved not to allow any chance of his being
found guilty, and so refused to plead, in order
that his estates might go to whom he willed.
Glynn was the Lord Chief Justice on this
occasion, and in passing the usual sentence for
<i>Peine forte et dure</i>, used instead of the word
"weights," as above, the words "as much iron<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and stone as he can bear," doubtless to suit the
prison convenience, and make the sentence
perfectly legal. He was to have three morsels
of barley bread every alternate day, and three
draughts of "the water in the next channel to
the prison door, but of no spring or fountain
water," the sentence concluding, "and this shall
be his punishment till he die." This was probably
on the Saturday, for on the Monday morning
following, it is stated, the condemned was draped
in white garments, and also wore a mourning
cloak, as though in mourning for his own forthcoming
death. It is curious to notice that his
friends were present at his death, which was so
much modified from the lengthy process that
his sentence conveys as to be in fact an
execution, in which these same friends assisted.
They stood "at the corner of the press," and
when he gave them to understand that he was
ready, they forthwith proceeded to pile stone and
iron upon him. The amount of weight was
insufficient to kill him, for although he gasped,
"Lord Jesus, receive my soul," he still continued
alive until his friends, to hasten his departure,
stood upon the weights, a course which in about
ten minutes placed him beyond the reach of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
human barbarity which imposed upon friendship
so horrible a task.</p>

<p>In 1827, an Act was passed which directs the
court to enter a plea of "not guilty," when a
prisoner refuses to plead. It is surprising that the
inhuman practice of pressing to death should have
lingered so long. In this chapter we have only
given particulars of a few of the many cases which
have come under our notice in the legal byways
of old England.</p>

<h2>Drowning.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Among</span> the nations of antiquity, drowning
was a very common mode of execution.
Four-and-a-half centuries before the birth of
Christ, the Britons inflicted death by drowning in
a quagmire. In Anglo-Saxon times women found
guilty of theft were drowned. For a long period
in the Middle Ages, the barons and others who
had the power of administering laws in their
respective districts possessed a drowning pit and
a gallows.</p>

<p>Drowning was a punishment of King Richard
of the Lion Heart, who ordained by a decree that
it should be the doom of any soldier of his army
who killed a fellow-crusader during the passage to
the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The owner of Baynard's Castle, London, in the
reign of John, had the power of trying criminals,
and his descendants long afterwards claimed the
privilege, the most valued of which was the right
of drowning, in the Thames, traitors taken within
the limits of his territory.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>Bearing on this subject the annals of Sandwich
supply some important information. It is
recorded, that in the year 1313, "a presentment
was made before the itinerant Justices at Canterbury,
that the prior of Christ Church had, for nine
years, obstructed the high road leading from
Dover Castle to Sandwich by the sea-shore by a
water-mill, and the diversion of a stream called the
Gestlyng, where felons condemned to death within
the hundred should be drowned, but could not
be executed that way for want of water. Further,
that he raised a certain gutter four feet, and the
water that passed that way to the gutter ran to
the place where the convicts were drowned, and
from whence their bodies were floated to the
river, and that after the gutter was raised the
drowned bodies could not be carried into the
river by the stream, as they used to be, for want
of water."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Drowning was not infrequently awarded as a
matter of leniency, and as a commutation of what
were considered more severe forms of death. We
have an instance of such a case in Scotland in
1556, when a man who had been found guilty of
theft and sacrilege was ordered to be put to death<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
by drowning "by the Queen's special grace." At
Edinburgh, in 1611, a man was drowned for
stealing a lamb; and in 1623 eleven gipsey
women were condemned to be drowned at Edinburgh
in the Nor' Loch. On the 11th May, 1685,
Margaret M'Lachlan, aged sixty-three years, and
Margaret Wilson, a girl of eighteen years, were
drowned in the waters of Blednoch, for denying
that James VII. of Scotland was entitled to rule
the Church according to his pleasure. Six years
prior to this, namely, on the 25th August, 1679,
a woman called Janet Grant was tried for theft, in
the baronial court of Sir Robert Gordon, of Gordonston,
held at Drainie, and pleaded guilty.
She was sentenced to be drowned next day in the
Loch of Spynie.</p>

<p>In France, drowning was a capital punishment
as late as 1793, but in Scotland we do not trace
it later than 1685, and in England it was discontinued
about the commencement of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<h2>Burning to Death.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Burning</span> to death was a frequent method
of punishment in the barbarous days of
many nations. In our own country it was used
by the Anglo-Saxons as the penalty of certain
crimes, and, as the ordinary punishment of witchcraft,
it was maintained throughout the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>Burning alive was from early times the recognised
method of uprooting heretical notions
of religious belief of every class. The first to
suffer from this cause in England was Alban, who
died at the stake in the year <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 304. Since his
day, thousands have suffered death on account of
their religious belief, through intolerance; but
that is not a subject we intend dealing with at the
present time.</p>

<p>We desire to direct attention to some of the
cases of the burning alive of women for civil
offences. This practice was considered by the
framers of the law as a commutation of the sentence
of hanging, and a concession made to the sex of
the offenders. "For as the decency due to the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sex," says Blackstone, "forbids the exposing and
publicly mangling their bodies, their sentence
(which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the
other) is, to be drawn to the gallows, and there
to be burnt alive;" and he adds: "the humanity
of the English nation has authorised, by a tacit
consent, an almost general mitigation of such part
of these judgments as savours of torture and
cruelty, a sledge or hurdle being usually allowed
to such traitors as are condemned to be drawn,
and there being very few instances (and those
accidental and by negligence) of any persons
being disemboweled or burnt till previously deprived
of sensation by strangling."</p>

<p>We gather from the annals of King's Lynn
that, in the year 1515, a woman was burnt in the
market-place for the murder of her husband.
Twenty years later, a Dutchman was burnt for
reputed heresy. In the same town, in 1590,
Margaret Read was burnt for witchcraft. Eight
years later, a woman was executed for witchcraft,
and in the year 1616, another woman suffered
death for the same crime. In 1791, at King's
Lynn, the landlady of a public-house was
murdered by a man let into the house at the
dead of night by a servant girl. The man was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hanged for committing the crime, and the girl
was burnt at the stake for assisting the murderer
to enter the dwelling.</p>

<p>There is an account of a burning at Lincoln, in
1722. Eleanor Elsom was condemned to death
for the murder of her husband, and was ordered
to be burnt at the stake. She was clothed in a
cloth, "made like a shift," saturated with tar, and
her limbs were also smeared with the same inflammable
substance, while a tarred bonnet had been
placed on her head. She was brought out of the
prison barefoot, and, being put on a hurdle, was
drawn on a sledge to the place of execution near
the gallows. Upon arrival, some time was passed
in prayer, after which the executioner placed her
on a tar barrel, a height of three feet, against the
stake. A rope ran through a pulley in the stake,
and was placed around her neck, she herself
fixing it with her hands. Three irons also held
her body to the stake, and the rope being pulled
tight, the tar barrel was taken aside and the fire
lighted. The details in the "Lincoln Date
Book" state that she was probably quite dead
before the fire reached her, as the executioner
pulled upon the rope several times whilst the irons
were being fixed. The body was seen amid the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
flames for nearly half-an-hour, though, through the
dryness of the wood and the quantity of tar, the
fire was exceedingly fierce.</p>

<p>An instance in which the negligence of the
executioner caused death to be unnecessarily
prolonged is found in the case of Catherine Hayes,
who was executed at Tyburn, November 3rd, 1726,
for the murder of her husband. She was being
strangled in the accustomed manner, but the fire
scorching the hands of the executioner, he relaxed
the rope before she had become unconscious, and
in spite of the efforts at once made to hasten
combustion, she suffered for a considerable time
the greatest agonies.</p>

<p>Two paragraphs, dealing with such cases, are
in the <i>London Magazine</i> for July, 1735, and are
as follow: "At the assizes, at Northampton,
Mary Fawson was condemned to be burnt for
poisoning her husband, and Elizabeth Wilson to
be hanged for picking a farmer's pocket of thirty
shillings."</p>

<p>"Among the persons capitally convicted at the
assizes, at Chelmsford, are Herbert Hayns, one
of Gregory's gang, who is to be hung in chains,
and a woman, for poisoning her husband, is to be
burnt."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next number of the same magazine, the
first-mentioned criminal is again spoken of:
"Mrs. Fawson was burnt at Northampton for
poisoning her husband. Her behaviour in prison
was with the utmost signs of contrition. She
would not, to satisfy people's curiosity, be unveiled
to anyone. She confessed the justice of her
sentence, and died with great composure of
mind." And also: "Margaret Onion was burnt
at a stake at Chelmsford, for poisoning her
husband. She was a poor, ignorant creature, and
confessed the fact."</p>

<p>We obtain from Mr. John Glyde, jun.,
particulars of another case of burning for husband
murder (styled petty treason). In April, 1763,
Margery Beddingfield, and a farm servant, named
Richard Ringe, her paramour, had murdered
John Beddingfield, of Sternfield. The latter
criminal was the actual murderer, his wife being
considered an accomplice. He was condemned to
be hanged and she burnt, at the same time and
place, and her sentence was that she should "be
taken from hence to the place from whence you
came, and thence to the place of execution, on
Saturday next, where you are to be burnt until
you be dead: and the Lord have mercy on your<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
soul." Accordingly, on the day appointed, she
was taken to Rushmere Heath, near Ipswich, and
there strangled and burnt.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Coining was, until a late period, an offence
which met with capital punishment. In May,
1777, a girl of little more than fourteen years of
age had, at her master's command, concealed a
number of whitewashed farthings to represent
shillings, for which she was found guilty of treason,
and sentenced to be burnt. Her master was
already hanged, and the fagots but awaiting the
application of the match to blaze in fury around
her, when Lord Weymouth, who happened to be
passing that way, humanely interfered. Said a
writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, "a mere accident
saved the nation from this crime and this national
disgrace."</p>

<p>In Harrison's <i>Derby and Nottingham Journal</i>,
for September 23rd, 1779, is an account of two
persons who were several days previously tried
and convicted for high treason, the indictment
being for coining shillings in Cold Bath Field,
and for coining shillings in Nag's Head Yard,
Bishopsgate Street. The culprit in the latter case
was a man named John Fields, and in the former<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a woman called Isabella Condon. They were
sentenced to be drawn on a hurdle to the place
of execution, the man to be hanged and the
woman burnt.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be Harris, in 1786, was burnt in front of
Newgate. The <i>Chelmsford Chronicle</i> of June
23rd, 1786, gives an account of her execution.
After furnishing particulars of six men being
hanged for various crimes, the report says:</p>

<p>"About a quarter of an hour after the platform
had dropped, the female convicted" (Ph&#339;be
Harris, convicted of counterfeiting the coin called
shillings) "was led by two officers of justice from
Newgate to a stake fixed in the ground about
midway between the scaffold and the pump. The
stake was about eleven feet high, and, near the
top of it was inserted a curved piece of iron, to
which the end of the halter was tied. The
prisoner stood on a low stool, which, after the
ordinary had prayed with her a short time, being
taken away, she was suspended by the neck (her
feet being scarcely more than twelve or fourteen
inches from the pavement). Soon after the signs
of life had ceased, two cart-loads of fagots were
placed round her and set on fire; the flames
presently burning the halter, the convict fell a few<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
inches, and was then sustained by an iron chain
passed over her chest and affixed to the stake.
Some scattered remains of the body were perceptible
in the fire at half-past ten o'clock. The
fire had not completely burnt out at twelve
o'clock."</p>

<p>The latest instance on record is that of
Christian Murphy, <i>alias</i> Bowman, who was burnt
on March 18th, 1789, for coining.</p>

<p>The barbarous laws which permitted such repugnant
exhibitions were repealed by the 30th George
III., cap. 48, which provided that, after the 5th
of June, 1790, women were to suffer hanging,
as in the case of men.</p>

<h2>Boiling to Death.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the year 1531, when Henry VIII. was king,
an act was passed for boiling poisoners to
death. The preamble of the statute states that
one Richard Roose or Coke, a cook, by putting
poison in some food intended for the household of
the Bishop of Rochester, and for the poor of the
parish in which his lordship's palace was situated
in Lambeth Marsh, occasioned the death of a man
and a woman, and the serious illness of several
others. He was found guilty of treason, and
sentenced to be boiled to death, without benefit
of clergy, that is, that no abatement of the
sentence was to be made on account of his
ecclesiastical connection, nor to be allowed any
indemnity such as was commonly the privilege of
clerical offenders. He was publicly boiled to
death at Smithfield, and the act ordained that all
manner of poisoners should meet with the same
doom henceforth.</p>

<p>A maid-servant, for poisoning her mistress, was,
in 1531, boiled to death in the market-place of
King's Lynn. Another instance of a servant<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
poisoning the persons with whom she lived was
Margaret Davy, who perished at Smithfield, in
1542.</p>

<p>This cruel law did not remain long on the
Statute Books; shortly after the death of Henry
VIII., and in the reign of the next king, Edward
VI., it was, in 1547 repealed. The punishment
of boiling alive was by no means uncommon
before the enactment of Henry VIII., both in
England and on the Continent.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2>Beheading.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Beheading</span>, as a mode of punishment,
had an early origin. Amongst the Romans
it was regarded as a most honourable death. It
is asserted that it was introduced into England
from Normandy by William the Conqueror, and
intended for the putting to death of criminals
belonging to the higher grades of society. The
first person to suffer beheading was Waltheof,
Earl of Huntingdon, Northampton, and Northumberland,
in 1076.</p>

<p>Since the days of the first Norman king down
to the time of George the Second in 1747, two
monarchs, and not a few of the most notable of the
nobility of Great Britain, at the Tower, Whitehall,
near the historic Tolbooth of Edinburgh, and
other places have closed their noble, and in some
instances ignoble, careers at the hands of the
headsman.</p>

<p>Charles I. is perhaps the most famous of kings
that have been beheaded. On January 30th,
1649, on a scaffold raised before the Banqueting
House at Whitehall, he was executed. Within<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the Banqueting Hall of the Castle of Fotheringay,
on February 8th, 1587, the executioner from the
Tower, after three blows from an axe, severed
the head from the body of Mary, Queen of
Scots. Her earlier years opened in the gay
court of France, and was full of sunshine, but
shadows gathered, and she was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A sad prisoner, passing weary years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many castles, till at Fotheringay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joyless life was ended."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Henry VIII. was a great king, but his cruel
attitude towards his queens will ever diminish his
glory; two of them were executed at his instigation
at the Tower, namely, Anne Boleyn, on May 19th,
1536, and Katherine Howard, on February 13th,
1542. In the death at the block of Lady Jane
Grey, "the nine days' queen," the scene is more
pathetic and picturesque. On February 12th,
1553-4, she and her young husband, Lord Guildford
Dudley, were executed at the Tower, the
former on the Green within the ancient stronghold,
and the latter on Tower Hill. The story of her
unhappy fate is one of the most familiar pages
of English history. Fuller said of this noble
woman: "She had the innocency of childhood,
the beauty of youth, the solidity of middle, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

THE TOWER OF LONDON, SHOWING THE SITE OF THE SCAFFOLD.</div>

<p>Amongst the notable men who have suffered at<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Tower, we must mention John Fisher, Bishop
of Rochester, beheaded on Tower Hill, June
23rd, 1535. He had nearly reached the age of
four score years. The Pope, to spite Henry VIII.,
had sent the prelate a cardinal's hat, but the aged
bishop had suffered death before it reached this
country. Sir Thomas More was executed on
July 6th, 1535. Like his friend Fisher, he refused
submission to the Statute of Succession and to the
King's Supremacy. The devotion of Margaret
Roper to her father, Sir Thomas More, forms an
attractive feature in the life story of this truly
great man. After execution his head was spiked
on London Bridge, and she bribed a man to move
it, and drop it into a boat where she sat. She
kept the sacred relic for many years, and at her
death it was buried with her in a vault under St.
Dunstan's Church, Canterbury.</p>

<p>George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, was
beheaded on May 17th, 1536, two days before the
execution of his sister, Queen Anne Boleyn; and
his wife, Jane, Viscountess Rochford, was
beheaded at Tower Hill, with Katherine Howard,
on February 13th, 1542, on the charge of having
been an accomplice in the queen's treason. On
July 28th, 1540, Thomas Cromwell, Earl of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Essex, was executed. Margaret Plantagenet,
Countess of Salisbury, opposed the king and his
government, and she was condemned for high
treason. On May 27th, 1541, her earthly career
closed. "The haughty old countess," it is
recorded, "refused to lay her head upon the
block, and the headsman had to follow her about
the scaffold, and to 'fetch-off' her grey head
'slovenly' as he could."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> She was nearly seventy
years old.</p>

<p>The following are included in the list of notable
men beheaded, and in most instances we are only
able to give their names and dates of execution,
but the story of their careers will be found in the
pages of English history. Henry, Earl of
Surrey, beheaded January 19th, 1546-7; Thomas,
Lord Seymour of Sudeley, March 27th, 1548-9;
Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, January
22nd, 1551-2; Sir Thomas Arundel, February
26th, 1551-2; John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland,
August 22nd, 1553. Next comes
Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, executed February
22nd, 1553-4. He was the father of Lady Jane
Grey. Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk,
suffered death June 2nd, 1572. On February<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
25th, 1600-1, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex,
was beheaded.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was a many-sided man, the
discoverer of North Carolina, the defender of his
country, an author, a court favourite, and a man
of undaunted courage. In the Tower he was
long a prisoner, and there wrote some notable
books, and the following hymn:&mdash;</p>

AXE, BLOCK, AND EXECUTIONER'S MASK AT THE TOWER OF LONDON.</div>

<p>On October 29th, 1618, Sir Walter Raleigh
was executed at Whitehall under a sentence
which had hung over his head for fifteen years.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 12th, 1641, was executed Wentworth,
Earl of Strafford; and on January 10th, 1644-5,
was beheaded Archbishop Laud. William
Howard, Viscount Stafford, a victim of Oates's
perjury, was executed on December 29th, 1680.
"Having embraced and taken leave of his
friends," says Bell, "he knelt down and placed his
head on the block: the executioner raised the axe
high in the air, but then checking himself
suddenly lowered it. Stafford raised his head and
asked the reason of the delay. The executioner
said he waited the signal. 'I shall make no
sign,' he answered, 'take your own time.' The<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
executioner asked his forgiveness. 'I do forgive
you,' replied Stafford, and placing his head again
in position, at one blow it was severed from his
body."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

LORD LOVAT (<i>from a drawing by Hogarth</i>).</div>

<p>A noted name in history comes next, the Duke
of Monmouth. He was beheaded July 15th,
1685. "Here are six guineas for you," he said to
the executioner, "and do not hack me as you did
my Lord Russell. I have heard that you struck
him three or four times. My servant will give
you more gold if you do your work well." Then
he undressed, felt the edge of the axe, and laid
his head on the block. The executioner was
unnerved, he raised his axe, but his arm trembled
as it fell, and only a slight wound was inflicted.
Several blows were given before the neck was
severed.</p>

<p>We are now nearing the end of executions at
the Tower, and only three more names occur.
The cause of Prince Charlie was supported by
not a few of the best blood of Scotland, but the
battle of Culloden ended all hopes for the Pretender,
and brought misery to many of his brave
followers. William, Earl of Kilmarnock, and
Arthur, Lord Balmerino, on August 18th, 1746,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were beheaded for their devotion to the Jacobite
cause. Simon, Lord Fraser of Lovat, had passed
a shameless life, and little can be said in his favour.
In 1715, he fought against Prince Charles Edward,
but subsequently joined the Jacobites, and took
part in the battle of Culloden. He managed to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
escape from the field after the engagement, and it
was not until April 9th, 1747, that he was beheaded
on Tower Hill. On reaching the scaffold, he asked
for the executioner, and presented him with a
purse containing ten guineas. He then asked to
see the axe, felt its edge, and said he thought it
would do. Next he looked at his coffin, on which
was inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Simon, Dominus Fraser de Lovat</span>,<br />
Decollat April 9, 1747,<br />
&AElig;tat suae 80.</div>

<p>After repeating some lines from Horace, and next
from Ovid, he prayed, then bade adieu to his
solicitor and agent in Scotland; finally the executioner
completed his work, the head falling from
the body. Lord Lovat was the last person
beheaded in this country.</p>

<h2>The Halifax Gibbet.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> mention of the Halifax gibbet suggests
a popular Yorkshire saying: "From Hell,
Hull and Halifax, good Lord, deliver us." Fuller
says the foregoing is part of the "Beggars' and
Vagrants' Litany," and goes on to state: "Of
these three frightful things unto them, it is to be
feared that they least fear the first, conceiving it
the farthest from them. Hull is terrible to them
as a town of good government, where beggars
meet with punitive charity; and, it is to be feared,
are oftener corrected than amended. Halifax is
formidable for the law thereof, whereby thieves,
taken in the very act of stealing cloth, are
instantly beheaded with an engine, without any
further legal proceedings. Doubtless, the coincidence
of the initial letters of these three words
helped much the setting on foot of the proverb."
The Halifax gibbet law has been traced back to
a remote period. It has been suggested that it
was imported into the country by some of the
Norman barons. Holinshed's "Chronicle" (edition
published in 1587) contains an interesting<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
note bearing on this subject. "There is, and has
been, of ancient time," says Holinshed, "a law
or rather custom, at Halifax, that whosoever
doth commit any felony, and is taken with the
same, or confesses the fact upon examination, if it
be valued by four constables to amount to the
sum of thirteenpence-halfpenny, he is forthwith
beheaded upon one of the next market-days
(which fall usually upon the Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays), or else upon the same day that
he is convicted, if market be holden. The engine
wherewith the execution is done is a square
block of wood, of the length of four feet and a
half, which doth ride up and down in a slot, rabet,
or regall, between two pieces of timber that are
framed and set up right, of five yards in height.
In the nether end of a sliding block is an axe,
keyed or fastened with an iron into the wood,
which, being drawn up to the top of the frame,
is there fastened by a wooden pin (with a notch
made in the same, after the manner of a Samson's
post), unto the middest of which pin also there is
a long rope fastened, that cometh down among
the people; so that when the offender hath made
his confession, and hath laid his neck over the
nethermost block, every man there present doth<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
either take hold of the rope (or putteth forth his
arm so near to the same as he can get, in token
that he is willing to see justice executed), and
pulling out the pin in this manner, the head-block
wherein the axe is fastened doth fall down
with such a violence, that if the neck of the
transgressor were so big as that of a bull, it
should be cut in sunder at a stroke, and roll from
the body by a huge distance. If it be so that
the offender be apprehended for an ox, sheep,
kine, horse, or any such cattle, the self beast or
other of its kind shall have the end of the rope
tied somewhere unto them, so that they, being
driven, do draw out the pin, whereby the offender
is executed."</p>

<p>In the illustration we give, which is a reproduction
of an old picture, it will be observed that a
horse is drawing the rope to loosen the pin, and
to allow the axe to fall and cut off the head of the
victim. The doomed man had doubtless stolen
the horse. Near the gibbet are assembled the
jurymen, and the parish priest is engaged in
prayer.</p>

HALIFAX GIBBET.</div>

<p>Before a felon was condemned to suffer, the
proof of certain facts appears to have been
essentially necessary. In the first place, he was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to be taken in the liberty of the forest of Hardwick,
and if he escaped out of it, even after condemnation,
he could not be brought back to be
executed; but if he ever returned into the liberty
again, and was taken, he was sure to suffer. It
is recorded that a man named Lacy escaped, and
resided seven years out of the forest, but returning,
was beheaded on the former verdict. This
person was not so wise as one Dinnis, who, having
been condemned to die, escaped out of the liberty
on the day fixed for his execution (which might be
done by running in one direction about five
hundred yards), and never returned. Meeting
several people that asked if Dinnis was not to be
beheaded on that day, his answer was, "I trow
not," which, having some humour in it, became a
proverbial saying in the district, and is used to
this day&mdash;"'I trow not,' quoth Dinnis." In the
next place, the fact was to be proved in the
clearest manner. The offender had to be taken
either hand-habend or back-berand, that is,
having the stolen goods in his hand, or bearing
them on his back, or, lastly, confessing that he
took them.</p>

<p>The value of the goods stolen had to be worth
at least thirteenpence-halfpenny, or more. Taylor,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the water-poet, refers to the subject as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At Halifax the law so sharpe doth deale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whoso more than thirteenpence doth steale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have a jyn that wondrous quick and well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends thieves all headless into heaven or hell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A further condition of the Halifax gibbet law
is scarcely so clear as the preceding. The
accused was, after three market or meeting days,
within the town of Halifax, next after his
apprehension and being condemned, taken to the
gibbet. This probably means that after he was
delivered to the bailiff, no time further than was
necessary was to elapse before proceeding to the
trial, and that the bailiff was to send speedy
summons to those who were to try him, which
might be done in two or three days. If he were
found guilty, the day of his execution depended upon
that of his sentence, for he was to be beheaded
on no other day than Saturday, which was the great
meeting. Thus, if condemned on Monday, he
would be kept three market days; but if condemned
on Saturday, as some assert, he would be
conducted straightway to the gibbet. The two
last persons who suffered death by this engine
were condemned and executed on the same day.</p>

<p>The final ordinance of the law directs that on<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
being led to the gibbet the malefactor is to have
his head cut off from his body. That the
machine was fully capable of this is evident both
from Holinshed's remarks and from the following
anecdote given by Wright, the historian of Halifax,
as an extract from "A Tour through the
Whole Island of Great Britain." A country
woman, who was riding by the gibbet at the time
of the execution of a criminal, had hampers at
her sides, and the head, bounding to a considerable
distance from the force of the descending
axe, "jumped into one of the hampers, or, as
others say, seized her apron with its teeth, and
there stuck for some time."</p>

<p>The parish register at Halifax contains a list of
forty-nine persons who suffered by the gibbet,
commencing on the 20th day of March, 1541, the
earliest date of which there is a recorded execution,
and terminating on the 30th day of April,
1650. After which latter execution the bailiff of the
town received an intimation that should another
case occur, he would be called to public account.
The number of beheadals in each of the reigns
comprised in the above dates are: five in the last
six years of the reign of Henry VIII.; twenty-five
in the reign of Elizabeth; seven in the reign<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of James I.; ten in the reign of Charles I.; two
during the Commonwealth.</p>

HALIFAX GIBBET, BY HOYLE.</div>

<p>In the year 1650, John Hoyle made a drawing
of the Halifax gibbet, which is regarded as a
faithful representation of it. On the crown of
the hill will be noticed
a sketch of the ancient
beacon.</p>

<p>An account of the
last occasion upon
which the services of
the Halifax gibbet
were called into requisition
is interesting;
it is contained in a
rare book: "Halifax
and its Gibbet Law
placed in a True
Light." It was written by Dr. Samuel Midgley,
during an imprisonment for debt, and was published
in 1708. "About the latter end of
April, <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1650, Abraham Wilkinson, John
Wilkinson, and Anthony Mitchel were apprehended
within the Manor of Wakefield and the
liberties of Halifax, for divers felonious practices,
and brought or caused to be brought into the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
custody of the chief bailiff of Halifax, in order to
have their trials for acquittal or condemnation,
according to the custom of the Forest of Hardwick,
at the complaint and prosecution of Samuel
Colbeck of Wardley, within the liberty of
Halifax; John Fielden of Stansfield, within the
said liberty; and John Cusforth of Durker, in
the parish of Sandall, within the Manor of Wakefield."
The Bailiff, according to the ancient
custom, issued a summons to the "several constables
of Halifax, Sowerby, Warley, and Skircoat,"
charging them to appear at his house on
the 27th day of April, 1650, each accompanied by
four men, "the most ancient, intelligent, and of
the best ability" within his constabulary, to
determine the cases. The constables were
merely the law officers, the jurors being the
sixteen "most ancient men," and whose names
are given at length. They were empanelled in
a convenient room at the Bailiff's house, where
the accused and their prosecutors were brought
"face to face" before them, as also the stolen
goods, to be by them viewed, examined, and
appraised. The court was opened by the following
address from the Bailiff: "Neighbours and
friends,&mdash;You are summoned hither and empanelled<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
according to the ancient custom of the
Forest of Hardwick, and by virtue you are
required to make diligent search and inquiry
into such complaints as are brought against the
felons, concerning the goods that are set before
you, and to make such just, equitable, and faithful
determination betwixt party and party, as
you will answer between God and your own
conscience." He then addressed them on the
separate charges against the prisoners. From
Samuel Colbeck, of Warley, they were alleged to
have stolen sixteen yards of russet-coloured
kersey, which the jury valued at 1s. per yard.
Two of the prisoners were alleged to have stolen
from Durker Green, two colts, which were
produced in court, one of which was appraised at
&pound;3, and the other at 48s. Also, Abraham
Wilkinson was charged by John Fielden with
stealing six yards of cinnamon-coloured kersey,
and eight yards of white "frized, for blankets."
After some debate concerning certain evidence
against the above, and "after some mature consideration,
the jury, as is customary in such
cases," adjourned to the 30th day of April.
Upon this day they met, and after further full
examination gave their verdict in writing, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
directed that the prisoners Abraham Wilkinson
and Anthony Mitchel, "by ancient custom, and
liberty of Halifax, whereof the memory of man is
not to the contrary, the said Abraham Wilkinson
and Anthony Mitchel are to suffer death by
having their heads severed and cut off from their
bodies at the Halifax gibbet, unto which verdict
we subscribe our names." The felons were
executed upon the same day.</p>

<p>The stone scaffold or pedestal upon which the
gibbet was erected was discovered by the Town
Trustees in 1840, in attempting to reduce what
was known as Gibbet Hill to the level of the
neighbouring ground; and except some decay of
the top and one of the steps, it is in a perfect
state. It is carefully fenced round, and an
inscription affixed, which was done at the cost of
Samuel Waterhouse, Mayor, in 1852. The gibbet
axe, formerly in the possession of the Lord of the
Manor of Wakefield, is now preserved at the
Rolls Office of that town. It weighs seven
pounds twelve ounces; its length is ten inches
and a half; it is seven inches broad at the top,
and nearly nine at the bottom, and at the centre
about seven and a half.</p>

<h2>The Scottish Maiden.</h2>

THE TOLBOOTH, EDINBURGH.</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Towards</span> the middle of the sixteenth
century, the Earl of Morton, Regent of
Scotland, during a visit to England, witnessed an
execution by the Halifax gibbet. He appears to
have been impressed in a favourable manner with
the ingenuity of the machine, and gave directions
for a model of it to be made, and on his return
home, in the year 1565, he had a similar gibbet
constructed. On account of remaining so long
before it was used, so runs the popular story, it
was known as "The Maiden." Dr. Charles
Rogers says that its appellation is from the Celtic
<i>mod-dun</i>, originally signifying the place where
justice was administered.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It is generally
believed that the first victim beheaded at the
Maiden was the Earl of Morton himself, but such
was not the case, for he did not suffer death by it
until June 2nd, 1581. He ruled Scotland for ten
years, winning the approbation of Queen Elizabeth,
but finally he fell a victim to the court faction. It
has been said that probably it could not have availed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
against him but for his own greed and cruelty.
In trying to picture the scene of Morton's
execution, says a painstaking author, it must
have been a striking sight when the proud, stern,
resolute face, which had frowned so many better
men down, came to
speak from the
scaffold, protesting
his innocence of the
crime for which
he had been condemned,
but owning
sins enough to
justify God for his
fate.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He died by
the side of the City
Cross, in the High
Street, Edinburgh,
and for the next
twelve months his
head garnished a pinnacle on the neighbouring
Tolbooth.</p>

<div class="figl" style="width: 197px;">

THE SCOTTISH MAIDEN.</div>

<p>It is agreed by authorities that the first time
the Maiden was used was at the execution of the
inferior agents in the assassination of Rizzio, which<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
occurred at Holyrood Palace, on the 9th of
March, 1566.</p>

<p>The list of those who have suffered death at
the Maiden extends to at least one hundred and
twenty names, not a few of whom Scotland
delights to honour, including Sir John Gordon, of
Haddo; President Spottiswood, the Marquis and
the Earl of Argyle.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Earl of Argyle met his doom
with firmness; when laying his head on the grim<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
instrument of death, he said it was "a sweet
Maiden, whose embrace would waft his soul into
heaven." The tragic story of the Earl of Argyle
has been ably told by Mr. David Maxwell, <span class="smcapl">C.E.</span>,
and his iniquitous death is one of many dark

<h2>Mutilation.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the earlier laws of England, mutilation or
dismembering was by no means an uncommon
punishment, more especially amongst the poor.
Men, says Pike, branded on the forehead, without
hands, without feet, without tongues, lived as an
example of the danger which attended the commission
of petty crimes, and as a warning to all
men who had the misfortune of holding no higher
position than that of a churl.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Wealthy people
might do wrong with impunity. It has been clearly
shown that there was one law for the rich, and
another for the poor, in England during the four
centuries which preceded the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>According to Pike, under the Danes, mutilation
was practised with perhaps greater severity than
under the rule of the Saxons. Amongst the horrors
of the Danish conquest were eyes plucked out;
the nose, ears, and the upper lip were cut off;
the scalp was torn away, and sometimes even,
there is reason to believe, the whole body was
flayed alive.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the first two Norman kings mutilation of
offenders was largely employed to preserve game
in their forests. They, however, only appear to
have enforced earlier laws. The earliest forest laws
of which we have any knowledge are those which
were promulgated about 1016 by Canute, the
Dane, and probably much the same as had existed
for a long period previously. The principal points
of their tyrannical laws were, that if a freedman
offered violence to a keeper of the King's deer,
he was liable to lose his freedom and property; if
a serf did the same, he lost his right hand; if the
offence was repeated, he paid the penalty with his
life. For killing a deer, either the eyes of the
offender were put out, or he was killed; if anyone
ran down a deer so that it panted, he was to pay at
least ten shillings in the money of the day. Such
was the law under the Saxon and the Danish
Kings. The laws protected the private estate
owner, and it was not until the Conqueror came
that all the forest land was considered the property
of the King.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry I. coiners of false money
were brought to Winchester and suffered there in
one day the loss of their right hands and of their
manhood. Under the Kings of the West Saxon<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
dynasty the loss of the right hand was a common
sentence for makers of base coin.</p>

<p>Several curious instances of mutilation are
mentioned in "The Obsolete Punishments of
Shropshire," by S. Meeson Morris. A case
occurring in the reign of King John provides
some interesting particulars. "In 1203," says Mr.
Morris, "at the Salop Assizes, Alice Crithecreche
and others were accused of murdering a woman at
Lilleshall. Alice immediately, after the murder,
had fled into Staffordshire with certain chattels of
the murdered woman in her possession, and had
been there arrested, and brought back into Shropshire.
Her defence before the <i>Curia Comitat&ucirc;s</i>
of Salop was at least ingenious:&mdash;She alleged that
on hearing a noise at night in the murdered woman's
house she went and peeped through a chink in the
door; that she saw four men within, who presently
coming out, seized, and threatened to murder her
if she made any alarm, but on her keeping silence,
gave her the stolen goods found upon her when
arrested. On being brought before the Justices-in-Eyre
at the above Assizes, Alice Crithecreche
no longer adhered to this defence, and she was
adjudged to deserve death, but the penalty was
commuted for one hardly less terrible. It was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
ordered that both her eyes should be plucked out."</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Suffolk Institute of
Arch&aelig;ology, held February 26th, 1889, Mr.
George E. Crisp, of Playford Hall, near Ipswich,
exhibited instruments used in the time of Henry
VIII. for cutting off the ears, as a penalty for not
attending Church.</p>

<p>In our chapter on the Pillory will be found
particulars of cases of mutilation of the ears.
The punishment of mutilation, except to the ears
of the offender, was not common for centuries
before the reign of Henry VIII., but by statute
33 Henry VIII., c. 12, the penalty for striking in
the King's court or house was declared to be the
loss of the right hand.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h2>Branding.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> mode of punishment was discontinued
in the reign of George III., and finally
abolished in 1829. Old laws contain many
allusions to the subject. In the reign of
Edward VI. was passed the famous Statute of
Vagabonds, authorising the branding with hot
iron the letter V on the breast of a runaway
slave. If, on being sold, he afterwards ran away,
he might be branded on the cheek or forehead
with the letter S, and thus the fact made known
to those who saw him that he was a slave.
Church brawlers in this reign were liable to be
branded on the cheek with the letter F, meaning
a fraymaker.</p>

<p>Gipsies were punished with branding. At
Haddington, in 1636, some gipsies were severely
dealt with, the men being condemned to be
hanged, the women drowned, with the exception
of those having children, and they were to be
scourged through the burgh and burnt on their
cheeks.</p>

<p>James Nayler, the Mad Quaker, who claimed to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
be the Messiah, as part of his punishment for
blasphemy, was condemned to have his tongue
bored through and his forehead branded with a
hot iron with the letter B, signifying that he was
a blasphemer.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Persons found guilty of petty offences and
claiming benefit of clergy were burnt on the
hand. Dr. Cox gives particulars of a case
occurring at the Derbyshire Sessions in 1696. A
butcher named Palmer, from Wirksworth, had
been found guilty of stealing a sheep. He
claimed benefit of clergy, which the court
granted, and he read. The court gave judgment
that he be burnt in his left hand, which was
executed. His troubles did not end with the
branding, for we find he had to "remaine in
Gaole till hee finde Sufficient Suretyes for his
Good behaviour to bee approved of and taken by
Recoign by Mr. Justice Pole and Mr. Justice
Borrowes, and for his appearance att next
Sessions, and then to abide further Order of this
Court."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="figr" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/024.png" width="334" height="332" alt="" title="" />
"A FAIR MARK, MY LORD."</div>

<p>We reproduce from a carefully written work
entitled, "In and Around Morecambe and Its<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Bay," issued by Mr. T. A. J. Waddington, York,
an old-time picture of a branding scene. In the
Lancaster Criminal Court is still preserved a
branding iron. "This iron," we are told, "is
attached to the back part of the dock; it consists
of a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end,
and the letter M at the other. In close proximity
are two iron loops designed for securing firmly<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the hand of the prisoner whilst the long piece of
iron was heated red hot, so that the letter
denoting 'Malefactor' could be impressed. The
brander, after doing his fiery task, examined the
hand, and on a good impression being made on
the brawny part running from the thumb, would
turn to the judge and exclaim&mdash;'A fair mark, my
Lord!'"</p>

<p>At the Assizes held at Northampton, in 1720,
before Mr. Justice Powis, the following prisoners
were adjudged to be branded:&mdash;"Silvester
Green, found guilty of sheep-stealing, burnt in the
Hand. And James Corby, the Pig Merchant,
had the Honour of the Brand confer'd on him
likewise: Jane Clarke, William and John Green,
convicted of several Petty Thefts and Larcenies,
are to travel for 7 years after the proper Officer
has kiss'd their Hand with a Red Hot Iron."</p>

<p>The foregoing list is drawn from the reports in
the <i>Northampton Mercury</i>, and in the same paper
for August 1st, 1721, it is stated "The following
Persons were try'd at The Assizes held for The
Town and County of Northampton, on Tuesday,
the 26th of this Instant. Isabella Chapman and
John Field were convicted of several Thefts and
Larcenies. To be burnt in The Hand and whipt;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and afterwards to be transported for 7 years.
Fielding's crime was stealing 12 sheep....
Isaac Emmerton, who was committed on the 21st
May last ... was burnt in The Hand."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Branding in some instances appears to have
been a mere farce. "When Charles Moritz, a
young German, visited England in 1782, he was
much surprised at this custom, and in his Diary
he mentions that a clergyman had fought a duel
with another in Hyde Park, and killed the man;
he was found guilty of manslaughter, and was
burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning
which was done with a cold iron."<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Such cases
as this prepared the way for abolishing the custom,
as cold irons for one class, and hot irons for
another, could not be tolerated.</p>

<p>It was customary to command criminals in the
courts in the past century to hold up their hands
to prove if previous convictions had been passed
upon them.</p>

<h2>The Pillory.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the history of our own and other European
countries, the pillory may be traced back to
remote times, and its origin is almost lost in the
mists of antiquity. Its story is one of tragedy
and comedy, and full of historic interest and
importance. In England, in bygone ages, the
pillory was a familiar object, and perhaps no
engine of punishment was more generally
employed. Where there was a market, the
pillory might be seen, for if the local authorities
neglected to have it ready for immediate use,
should occasion require it, they ran the risk of forfeiting
the right of holding a market, which was a
most serious matter in the olden time. Lords of
Manors, in addition to having the right of a
pillory, usually had a ducking-stool and gallows.
Thomas de Chaworth, in the reign of Edward
III., made a claim of a park, and the right of free
warren, at Alfreton, with the privilege of having
a gallows, tumbrel, and pillory.</p>

PILLORY, WHIPPING-POST, AND STOCKS, WALLINGFORD.</div>

<p>In the middle ages frequently a pillory,
whipping-post, and stocks were combined, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
we give a picture of a good example from
Wallingford, Berkshire. It will be observed that
they are planned to hold four delinquents, namely,
one in the pillory, one at the whipping-post, and
two in the stocks. They stood near the town
hall, in the market-place, down to about the year
1830, when the pillory and whipping-post were
taken down. The stocks remained for a few
years longer to remind the tippler of his fate, if
he overstepped the bounds of temperance and
was caught drunk. In course of time they fell<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
into disuse, and were finally presented by the
Corporation to Mr. J. Kirby Hedges, of Wallingford
Castle, the historian of the ancient town.
He informs us that there was a pillory at
Wallingford in 1231, and probably earlier.</p>

<div class="figl" style="width: 136px;">

OCKAM IN THE PILLORY.</div>

<p>A good representation of the pillory formerly
much used is furnished in a cut of Robert Ockam,
undergoing part of his sentence for perjury, in
the reign of Henry VIII.
In the year 1543, Ockam,
with two other criminals
mounted on horseback,
with papers on their heads,
and their faces towards
the tails of the horses, had
to ride about Windsor,
Newbury, and Reading,
and stand in the pillory
of each of the three
towns.</p>

<p>We give a view of an ancient pillory which
formerly stood in the market-place of the village
of Paulmy, in Touraine. It is copied from a
picture of the Castle of Paulmy in <i>Cosmographie
Universelle</i>, 1575. It will be observed that it is
planned for holding a number of offenders at the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
same time. This form of pillory was not generally
used. It was usually much simpler in construction,
and frequently was not a permanent structure.</p>

<div class="figr" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/027.png" width="175" height="313" alt="" title="" />
PILLORY FOR A NUMBER OF PERSONS.</div>

<p>Stow, in his "Survey of London," supplies a
description of the Cornhill pillory, and gives
particulars of the crimes
for which it was brought
into requisition. After
adverting to the making
of a strong prison of
timber, called a cage,
and fixing upon it a
pair of stocks for night-walkers,
he next tells
us: "On the top of
the cage was placed a
pillory, for the punishment
of bakers offending
in the assize of
bread; for millers stealing
of corn at the mill;
for bawds, scolds, and
other offenders." In the year 1468, the
seventh of Edward IV., divers persons, being
common jurors, such as at assizes, were forsworn
for rewards or favour of parties, and judged to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ride from Newgate to the pillory of Cornhill,
with mitres of paper on their heads, there to
stand, and from thence again to Newgate; and
this judgment was given by the Mayor of
London. In the year 1509, the first of Henry
VIII., Darby, Smith, and Simson, ringleaders of
false inquests in London, rode about the city with
their faces to horses' tails, and papers on
their heads, and were set on the pillory in Cornhill,
and afterwards brought again to Newgate,
where they died for very shame, saith Robert
Fabian.</p>

<p>A curious note, relating to this topic, appears
in the "Journal of Henry Machyn,
Citizen of London," published by the Camden
Society. It is stated that, on the 1st July, 1552,
there were a man and woman on the pillory in
Cheapside; the man sold pots of strawberries,
the which were not half full, but filled with fern.
On the 30th May, 1554, two persons were set on
the pillory, a man and woman; but the woman
had her ears nailed to the pillory for speaking
lies and uttering false rumours. The man
was punished for seditious and slanderous
words.</p>

<p>An instance of great severity is recorded in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
1621, when Edward Floyde was convicted of
having used slighting expressions concerning the
king's son-in-law, the Elector Palatine, and his
wife. The sentence was given as follows: (1)
Not to bear arms as a gentleman, nor be a
competent witness in any Court of Justice.
(2) To ride with his face to a horse's tail, to
stand in the pillory, and have his ears nailed, etc.
(3) To be whipped at the cart's tail. (4) To be
fined &pound;5,000. (5) To be perpetually imprisoned
in Newgate. It was questioned whether Floyde,
being a gentleman, should be whipped, and have
his ears nailed. It was agreed by a majority that
he should be subject to the former, but not to the
latter. He stood two hours in the pillory, and
had his forehead branded.</p>

<p>Pepys, writing in his diary under date of
March 26th, 1664, relates that he had been
informed by Sir W. Batten that "some 'prentices,
being put in the pillory to-day for beating of
their masters, or such-like things, in Cheapside, a
company of 'prentices came and rescued them,
and pulled down the pillory; and they being set
up again, did the like again." We may infer,
from the foregoing and other facts that have
come down to us respecting the London<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
apprentices, that they were a power in bygone
times, doing very much as they pleased.</p>

<p>We are enabled, by the courtesy of Messrs.
W. &amp; R. Chambers, to reproduce from their
"Book of Days" an excellent illustration of
Oates in the pillory (from a contemporary print).
"Found guilty," says the writer in the "Book of
Days," "of perjury on two separate indictments,
the inventor of the Popish Plot was condemned,
in 1685, to public exposure on three consecutive
days. The first day's punishment, in Palace
Yard, nearly cost the criminal his life; but his
partisans mustered in such force in the city, on
the succeeding day, that they were able to upset
the pillory, and nearly succeeded in rescuing
their idol from the hands of the authorities.
According to his sentence, Oates was to stand
every year of his life in the pillory, on five
different days: before the gate of Westminster
Hall, on the 9th August; at Charing Cross on
the 10th; at the Temple on the 11th; at the
Royal Exchange on the 2nd September; and
at Tyburn on the 24th April; but, fortunately for
the infamous creature, the Revolution deprived
his determined enemies of power, and turned the
criminal into a pensioner of Government."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>It was formerly a common custom to put
persons in the pillory during the time of public
market. We may name, as an example, a case
occurring at Canterbury, in 1524. A man was
set up in the pillory, which was in the Market
Place, and bearing on his head a paper inscribed,
"This is a false, perjured, and forsworn man."
He was confined in the pillory until the market
was over, and then led to Westgate and thrust
out of the town, still wearing the paper. "If he
be proud," says an old writer, "he may go home
and shew himself among his neighbours."</p>

<p>The Corporation accounts of Newcastle-on-Tyne
contain, among other curious items, the
following:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p class="noin">The "papers" above mentioned were for the
purpose of proclaiming to the world at large the
nature of the bearer's offence.</p>

<p>At Hull, in the year 1556, the town ordinances
were revised and proclaimed "in the Market
Place, in the market-time, according to the yearly
custom." The twenty-third rule runs as follows:
"That no person whomsoever presume to take
down and carry away, any brick or stones off
or from the town's walls, upon pain for every
default to be set upon the pillory, and to pay, for
a fine, to the town's chamber, forty shillings."
We may infer, from the foregoing, that the town's
walls, both the original stone portion of Edward
I., and the later addition of brick, were in a state
of demolition. In 1559, the aldermen of Hull
were directed to take account of "all vagabonds,
idle persons, sharpers, beggars, and such like;"
and, doubtless, not a few of the persons included
under these wide definitions would come to the
pillory, for the aldermen were ordered to "punish
them severely;" and, as the punishments of Hull
were largely in fines, Mr. Wildridge, author of
"Old and New Hull," suggests that the moneyless<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
classes of persons above-named would be most
economically and severely dealt with by pillorying.
About 1813, a man, for keeping a disreputable
house, was placed in the pillory erected in the
Market Place.</p>

<p>At Preston, Lancashire, in 1814, a man about
sixty years of age was pilloried for a similar
offence, and it is said that he was the last person
punished in this manner in the town.</p>

<p>The pillory at Driffield was movable, and when
in use stood in the Market Place, near the Cross
Keys Hotel. The last occupants, a man and a
woman, were pilloried together about 1810, for
fortune-telling. At Bridlington the pillory stood
in the Market Place, opposite the Corn Exchange.
It was taken down about 1835, and lay some time
in Well Lane, but it finally disappeared, and was
probably chopped up for firewood. Before its
removal there was affixed to it a bell, which was
rung to regulate the market hours. Mischievous
youths, however, often rang it, so it was taken
down in 1810, and kept at a house down a court,
known as Pillory Bell Yard.</p>

earliest notice of the pillory in Manchester," says
Mr. Axon, "is in the Court Leet Records, April
8th, 1624, when the jury referred the erection of
'a gibbett' to the discretion of the Steward and
the Boroughreeve. Some delay must have
occurred, for on April 8th, 1625, 'the jurye doth
order that the constables of this yeare, att the
charges of the inhabitants, shall cause to bee
erected and sett vp a sufficient gibbett or pilorye
for the vse of this towne, in some convenient
place about the Markett Crosse, and to take to
them the advice of Mr. Stewart and the Bororeve.
This to be done before the xxiiijth day of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
August next, subpena xx<sup>s</sup>.' This threat of a
penalty was effective, and the careful scribe notes
<i>factum est</i>. The convenient place was in the
market-place, close to the stocks. The pillory
remained, more or less in use, until 1816, when it
was removed. Barritt, the antiquary, made a
drawing of it, which has been engraved. It was
jocularly styled the 'tea table,' and was used as a
whipping place also. In the present century, it
was not a permanent fixture, but a movable
structure, set up when required. One pilloried
individual, grimly jesting at his own sorrows, told
an inquiring friend that he was celebrating his
nuptials with Miss Wood, and that his neighbour,
whom the beadle was whipping, had come to
dance at the wedding. During the Civil War,
there was a pillory for the special benefit of the
soldiers, and it was removed from the Corn
Market in 1651."</p>

PILLORY AT RYE.</div>

<p>The Rye pillory is still kept in the Town Hall,
and we give a picture of it from a photograph.
The last time it was used was in 1813, when a
publican was put in it for aiding the escape of
General Phillippon, a French prisoner of war, who
had been brought to this old Sussex town. The
pillory was erected on the beach, and the face of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the culprit turned to the coast of France. Mr.
Holloway, the local historian, supplied the late
Mr. Llewellyn Jewitt with some particulars
respecting this example. "It measures," says
Mr. Holloway, "about six feet in height, by four
in width. It consists of two up-posts affixed
to a platform, and has
two transverse rails, the
upper one of which is
divided horizontally, and
has a hinge to admit of
the higher portion being
lifted, so as to allow of
the introduction of the
culprit's head and hands.
Through the platform
and the lower rail there
are round perforations,
into which, when the
instrument was in requisition, an upright bar,
probably of iron, was introduced, so as to allow
the pillory, with its unfortunate tenant, to be
turned bodily round at pleasure."</p>

<p>The famous Lord Thurlow was eloquent for the
preservation of the pillory, which he called "the
restraint against licentiousness, provided by the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wisdom of past ages." This was in a case against
the Rev. Horne Tooke, who, escaped with a fine
of &pound;200. Of others, who have spoken for and
against it, may be mentioned Lord Macclesfield,
who, in 1719, condemned it as a punishment for
State criminals. In 1791, Pitt claimed to have
dissuaded the Government from its too frequent
use, as had Burke. Lord Ellenborough, in 1812,
sentenced a blasphemer to the pillory for two
hours once a month, for eighteen months. Again,
in 1814, he ordered Lord Cochrane, the famous
sea-fighter of Brasque Roads fame, to be pilloried
for conspiring with others to spread false news.
But his colleague, Sir Francis Burdett, declared
that he would stand by his side in the pillory
regardless of consequences. In the then state of
public opinion, the Government declined to undertake
the responsibility, and this punishment was
waived.</p>

THE CANG, CHINA.</div>

<p>It was no uncommon circumstance for the
offenders to be killed on the pillory, by the
pelting to which they were subjected by the
fury of the crowd. In 1731, a professional
witness, <i>i.e.</i>, one who, for the reward offered for
the conviction of criminals, would swear falsely
against them, was sentenced to the pillory of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Seven Dials, where so bitter were the populace
against him that they pelted him to death. The
coroner's jury returned a verdict of "wilful
murder by persons unknown." In 1756, the
drovers of Smithfield pelted two perjured thief-catchers
so violently that one died; in 1763,
a man died from a like cause, at Southwark;
in 1780, a coachman died from injuries before his
time had expired.</p>

<p>An amusing anecdote is related, bearing upon
a pillory accident. "A man being condemned to
the pillory in or about Elizabeth's time, the foot-board
on which he was placed proved to be rotten,
and down it fell, leaving him hanging by the
neck, in danger of his life. On being liberated, he
brought an action against the town for the
insufficiency of its pillory, and recovered
damages."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1816, the pillory ceased to be
employed for punishing persons, except in cases
of perjury, and for this crime a man was put in
the pillory in 1830. The pillory, in the year
1837, was abolished by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>At the present time in China, the Cang, or
Cangue is employed for punishing petty offenders.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
From a picture we give from an original sketch
recently made, it will be seen that it consists of a
large wooden collar
fitting close round the
neck. The size and
weight of the board
varies, but it is not to
be removed until the
completion of the sentence,
which may vary
in length from a couple
of weeks to three
months. The name of
the prisoner and the
nature of his crime are
written on the cang in
large letters. He is
left to public charity
for support, and frequently suffers from the
pangs of hunger.</p>

<h2>Punishing Authors and Burning Books.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Literary</span> annals contain many records of
the punishments of authors. The Greeks
and Romans frequently brought writers into
contempt by publicly burning their books. In
England, in years agone, it was a common
practice to place in the pillory authors who
presumed to write against the reigning monarch,
or on political and religious subjects which were
not in accord with the opinions of those in power.
The public hangman was often directed to make
bonfires of the works of offending authors. At
Athens, the common crier was instructed to burn
all the prohibited works of Pythagoras which could
be found. It is well known that Numa Pompilius
did much to build up the glory of Rome. It was
he who gave to his countrymen the ceremonial
laws of religion, and it was under his rule that
they enjoyed the blessings of peace. His death
was keenly felt by a grateful people, and he was
honoured with a grand and costly funeral. In
his grave were found some of his writings, which
were contrary to his religious teaching; and the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
fact being made known to the Senate, an order
was made directing the manuscripts to be consumed
by fire. In the days of Augustus, no fewer
than twenty thousand volumes were consigned on
one occasion to the flames. The works of
Labienus were amongst those which were burnt.
It was a terrible blow to the author and some of
his friends. Cassius Severus, when he heard the
sentence pronounced, exclaimed in a loud voice
that they must burn him also, for he had learnt
all the books by heart. It was the death-blow to
Labienus; he repaired to the tomb of his forefathers,
refused food, and pined away. It is
asserted that he was buried alive. At Constantinople,
Leo I. caused two hundred thousand
books to be consumed by fire.</p>

<p>The Bible did not escape the flames. It is
stated by Eusebius that, by the direction of
Diocletian, the Scriptures were burnt. According
to Foxe, the well-known writer on the martyrs,
on May, 1531, Bishop Stokesley "caused all the
New Testament of Tindal's translation, and many
other books which he had bought, to be openly
burnt in St. Paul's churchyard." It was there
that the Bishop of Rochester in a sermon
denounced Martin Luther and all his works. He<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
spoke of all who kept his books as accursed.
Not a few of the condemned works were
publicly burnt during the delivery of the sermon.</p>

<p>A man named Stubbs, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, lost his hand for writing a pamphlet
of Radical tendencies.</p>

<p>Collingbourne wrote the following couplet respecting
Catesby, Ratcliff, and Lovel giving their
advice to Richard III., whose crest, it will be
remembered, was a white boar:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The cat, the rat, and Lovel the dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rule all England under a hog."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For writing the foregoing couplet, Collingbourne
was executed on Tower Hill. After
"having been hanged," it is recorded, "he was
cut down immediately, and his entrails were then
extracted and thrown into the fire; and all this
was so speedily performed that," Stow says,
"when the executioner pulled out his heart, he
spoke, and said, 'Jesus, Jesus.'"</p>

<p>It is generally understood that Christopher
Marlowe translated, as a college exercise, "Amores
of Ovid." It was a work of unusual ability; but
did not, however, meet with the approval of
Archbishop Whitgift and Bishop Bancroft. In
consequence, in June, 1599, all copies were<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ordered to be burnt. A few escaped the fire,
and are now very valuable. Milton's books were
burnt by the common hangman, on August 27th,
1659.</p>

<p>In 1630, Dr. Leighton, a clergyman, and father
of the celebrated archbishop of that name, was
tried and found guilty of printing a work entitled,
"Zion's Plea against Prelacy," in which he called
bishops men of blood, ravens, and magpies, and
pronounced the institution of Episcopacy to be
satanical; he called the Queen a daughter of
Heth, and even commanded the murder of
Buckingham. His sentence was a hard one, and
consisted of a fine of &pound;10,000. He was also
degraded from the ministry, pilloried, branded, and
whipped; an ear was cropped off, and his nostrils
slit. After enduring these punishments, he was
sent to the Fleet prison. At the end of the
week, he underwent a second course of cruelty,
and was consigned to prison for life. After
eleven weary years passed in prison, Leighton
was liberated, the House of Commons having
reversed his sentence. He was told that his
mutilation and imprisonment had been illegal!
At that period in our history, a book or pamphlet
could not be printed without a license from the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London,
or the authorities of the two universities. Only
authorised printers were permitted to set up
printing presses in the city of London. Any
one printing without the necessary authority
subjected himself to the risk of being placed in
the pillory and whipped through the City.</p>

<p>Lilburne and Warton disregarded the foregoing
order, and printed and published libellous and
seditious works. They refused to appear before
the court where such offences were tried. The
authorities found them guilty, and fined each man
&pound;500, and ordered them to be whipped from
Fleet Prison to the pillory at Westminster. The
sentence was carried out on April the 18th, 1638.
Lilburne appears to have been a man of dauntless
courage, and when in the pillory, he gave away
copies of his obnoxious works to the crowd, and
addressed them on the tyranny of his persecutors.
He was gagged to stop his speech.</p>

<p>William Prynne lost his ears for writing
"Histrio-Mastix: the Player's Scourge, or
Actor's Tragedie" (1633.) His pillory experiences
were of the most painful character.</p>

<p>According to an entry in the annals of Hull, in
the year 1645, all the books of Common Prayer<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were burned by the Parliamentary soldiers, in
the market-place.</p>

<p>One of the late Mr. C. H. Spurgeon's predecessors,
named Benjamin Keach, a Baptist
Minister, of Winslow, in the County of Bucks,
issued a work entitled, "The Child's Instructor;
or, a New and Easy Primmer." The book was
regarded as seditious, and the authorities had him
tried for writing and publishing it, at the Aylesbury
Assizes, on the 8th October, 1664. The
judge passed on him the following sentence:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"Benjamin Keach, you are here convicted of writing and
publishing a seditious and scandalous Book, for which the
Court's judgment is this, and the Court doth award, That you
shall go to gaol for a fortnight, without bail or mainprise; and
the next Saturday to stand upon the pillory at Ailsbury for
the space of two hours, from eleven o'clock to one, with a
Paper upon your head with this inscription, <i>For writing,
printing and publishing a schismatical book, entitled, The
Child's Instructor, or a new and easy Primmer.</i> And the next
Thursday so stand in the same manner and for the same time
in the market of Winslow; and there your book shall be
openly burnt before your face by the common hangman, in
disgrace to you and your doctrine. And you shall forfeit to
the King's Majesty the sum of &pound;20 and shall remain in gaol
until you find sureties for your good behaviour and appearance
at the next assizes, there to renounce your doctrine, and to
make such public submission as shall be enjoined you."</p></div>

<div class="figr">
<img src="images/031.png" width="268" height="269" alt="" title="" />
BENJAMIN KEACH IN THE PILLORY.</div>

<p>We are told that Keach was kept a close<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
prisoner until the following Saturday, and on that
day was carried to the pillory at Aylesbury,
where he stood two hours without being permitted
to speak to the spectators. It is recorded
that his hands as well as his head were carefully
kept in the pillory the whole time. The
next Thursday he stood in the same manner
and length of time at Winslow, the town
where he lived, and his book was burnt before
him. "After this," we learn from Howell's
"State Trials," "upon paying his fine, and giving
sufficient security for his good behaviour, he was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
set at liberty; but was never brought to make
recantation."</p>

<p>Defoe wrote much and well. He was by birth
and education a Dissenter, and with much ability
asserted the rights of Nonconformists. At a
time when Churchmen were trying to obtain hard
measures against the Dissenters, he directed
against the Church party a severe satire, under
the title of "The Shortest Way with the
Dissenters." It exasperated the members of the
Government, and a reward of fifty pounds was
offered for his apprehension. The advertisement
respecting him is a literary curiosity, and appeared
in <i>The London Gazette</i>. It reads as follows:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"Whereas Daniel De Foe, <i>alias</i> De Fooe, is charged with
writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled, 'The
Shortest Way with the Dissenters.' He is a middle-sized,
spare man, about forty years old, of a brown complexion, and
dark brown coloured hair, but wears a wig, a hooked nose, a
sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth; was
born in London, and for many years was a hose factor, in
Truman's-yard, in Cornhill, and now is owner of a brick and
pantile works near Tilbury-fort, in Essex. Whoever shall
discover the said Daniel De Foe to any of her Majesty's
principal Secretaries of State, or any of Her Majesty's Justices
of the Peace, so as he may be apprehended, shall have a
reward of fifty pounds, which Her Majesty has ordered
immediately to be paid upon such discovery."</p></div>

<p class="noin">He managed to keep out of the way of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
authorities, but on hearing that the printer and
publisher of the pamphlet were put into prison,
he gave himself up, and they were set at liberty.
Defoe was tried at the Old Bailey, in July, 1704,
and pleaded guilty. It is said that he put in
this plea on the promise of pardon secretly given
to him. He did not, however, escape punishment;
he was fined two hundred marks, and ordered to
appear three times in the pillory, and remain in
prison during the Queen's pleasure.</p>

<p>During his imprisonment before being placed
in the pillory, he wrote the famous "Hymn to the
Pillory," which was speedily put into type and
sung by the crowd at the time Defoe was in the
machine. Here are some lines from it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hail hieroglyphic State machine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But at a loss to find his guilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can't commit his crimes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Defoe fared well in the pillory. He was not
pelted with rotten eggs, but with flowers; and
beautiful garlands were suspended from the pillory.
In a modest manner, he gave an account of the
affair. "The people," he wrote, "were expected
to treat me very ill, but it was not so. On the
contrary, they were with me&mdash;wished those who
had set me there were placed in my room, and
expressed their affections by loud thanks and
acclamations when I was taken down."</p>

<p>There is not the least truth in Pope's well-known,
and we may say disgraceful line:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Earless, on high stood unabash'd De Foe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After Defoe had spent about a year in prison,
the Queen sent to his wife money to pay the fine.</p>

<p>A work was issued in 1704, entitled, "The<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Superiority and Dominion of the Crown of
England over the Crown of Scotland," by
William Attwood. The Scottish Parliament had
the publication under consideration, and pronounced
it scurrilous and full of falsehoods, and
finally commanded the public hangman of Edinburgh
to burn the book.</p>

<p>Williams, the bookseller, was put in the pillory
in the year 1765, for republishing the <i>North
Briton</i> in forty-five volumes. "The coach," says
<i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, "that carried him
from the King's Bench Prison to the pillory was
No. 45. He was received with the acclamations
of a prodigious concourse of people. Opposite to
the pillory were erected two ladders, with cords
running from each other, on which were hung a
jack-boot, an axe, and a Scotch bonnet. The
latter, after remaining some time, was burnt, and
the top-boot chopped off. During his standing,
also, a purple purse, ornamented with ribbands of
an orange colour, was produced by a gentleman,
who began a collection in favour of the culprit by
putting a guinea into it himself, after which, the
purse being carried round, many contributed, to
the amount in the whole, as supposed, of about
two hundred guineas." The spectators loudly<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
cheered Mr. Williams on getting into and out
of the pillory. He held a sprig of laurel in his
hand during the time he was confined in the
pillory.</p>

<p>Alexander Wilson, the famous ornithologist
and poet, in the year 1793, was tried for publishing
some satirical poems concerning certain
Paisley manufacturers. The pieces were regarded
as libellous, and he was fined &pound;12 13s. 6d., and
condemned to burn in a public manner his poems
at the Market Cross at Paisley. The poet was
unable to pay the fine, and had to go to prison
for a short time. The circumstance was the chief
cause of Wilson leaving Scotland for America.</p>

<h2>Finger Pillory.</h2>

FINGER-PILLORY, ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCH.</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Finger pillories</span>, or stocks, in past
ages, were probably frequently employed in
the old manorial halls of England; but at the
present period only traces of a few are to be found.
The most interesting example is one in the parish
church of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire,
which has been frequently described and illustrated.
An account of it appears in <i>Notes
and Queries</i> of October 25th, 1851. It is described
as "fastened at its right hand extremity
into a wall, and consists of two pieces of oak; the
bottom and fixed piece is three feet eight inches
long; the width of the whole is four-and-a-half
inches, and when closed, it is five inches deep:
the left hand extremity is supported by a leg of
the same width as the top, and two feet six
inches in length; the upper piece is joined to the
lower by a hinge, and in this lower and fixed
horizontal part are a number of holes, varying in
size; the largest are towards the right hand:
these holes are sufficiently deep to admit the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
finger to the second joint, and a slight hollow is
made to admit the third one, which lies flat;
there is, of course, a corresponding hollow at the
top of the moveable part, which, when shut down,
encloses the whole finger." Thomas Wright,
<span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, in his "Arch&aelig;ological Album," gives an
illustration of the Ashby-de-la-Zouch example,
and we reproduce a copy. It shows the manner
in which the finger
was confined, and it
will easily be seen
that it could not be
withdrawn until the
pillory was opened.
If the offender were
held long in this
posture, the punishment
must have been
extremely painful.</p>

FINGER-PILLORY, LITTLECOTE HALL.</div>

<p>Amongst the old-time relics at Littlecote Hall,
an ancient Wiltshire mansion, may still be seen
a finger-pillory. It is made of oak. We give an
illustration of it from a drawing executed expressly
for this work. At Littlecote Hall it is spoken of
as an instrument of domestic punishment.</p>

FINGER-PILLORY, BEAUDESART.</div>

<p>Plot, in his "History of Staffordshire," published<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in 1686, gives an illustration of one of
these old-time finger-pillories. "I cannot forget,"
writes Plot, "a piece of art that I found in the
Hall of the Right Honourable William Lord
Paget, at Beaudesart, made for the punishment
of disorders that sometimes attend feasting, in
Christmas time, etc., called the finger-stocks, into
which the Lord of Misrule used to put the fingers
of all such persons as committed misdemeanours,
or broke such rules as, by consent, were agreed
on for the time of keeping Christmas among the
servants and others of promiscuous quality; these<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
being divided in like manner as the stocks of the
legs, and having holes of different sizes to fit for
scantlings of all fingers, as represented in the
table." We reproduce a sketch of Plot's picture.</p>

<p>In an account of the Customs of the Manor of
Ashton-under-Lyne, in the fifteenth century, it is
stated at the manorial festivals, "in order to
preserve as much as possible the degree of decorum
that was necessary, there were frequently
introduced a diminutive pair of stone stocks of
about eighteen inches in length, for confining
within them the fingers of the unruly."</p>

FINGER-PILLORY FROM AN OLD DAME'S SCHOOL.</div>

<p>In connection with this chapter may be fitly
included a picture of a finger-pillory in the
possession of Mr. England Howlett, Kirton-in-Lindsey,
Lincolnshire. Our illustration is half
the size of the original implement represented,
which is from a Welsh village. This ingenious<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
contrivance was used until the early part of this
century. It was kept on the dame's desk, and
when the children went up to say their lessons
they had to place their hands behind them,
putting their fingers into the holes of the pillory,
and bringing their hands back to back. When
properly fixed, the hands were quite fast and the
shoulders held well back. This kind of finger-pillory
was frequently used as a means of punishment
in schools.</p>

<h2>The Jougs.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> old-time instrument of punishment was
more generally used in North Britain than in
England. It was employed in Holland, and most
likely in other countries. In Scotland, its history
may be traced back to the sixteenth century, and
from that period down to about a hundred years
ago, it was a popular means of enforcing
ecclesiastical discipline, and was also brought
into requisition for punishing persons guilty of
the lesser civil offences. In Scotland the
jougs were usually fastened to a church door, a
tree in a churchyard, the post of a church gate,
a market cross, or a market tron, or weighing-post,
and not infrequently to prison doors.</p>

<p>The jougs are simple in form, consisting of an
iron ring or collar, with a joint or hinge at the
back to permit its being opened and closed, and in
the front are loops for the affixing of a padlock
to secure it round the neck of the culprit.</p>

<p>The "Diary of Henry Machyn, Citizen and
Merchant-Taylor of London, from <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1550 to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1563" (published by the Camden Society in
1848), contains the following note on the use of
the jougs: "The 30th day of June, 1553," it is
stated, "was set a post hard by the Standard in
Cheap, and a young fellow tied to the post with a
collar of iron about his neck, and another to the
post with a chain, and two men with two whips
whipping them about the post, for pretended
visions and opprobrious and seditious words."
We have modernised the spelling of Machyn.</p>

<p>Disregarding parental authority in Scotland
was frequently the cause of young folk being
punished by the jougs, and in other ways. Harsh
rules of life were by no means confined to North
Britain. In Tudor England manners were
severe and formal, parents exacting abject
deference from their offspring. A child did not
presume to speak or sit down without leave in
presence of its parents. A little leniency was
extended to girls, for when tired they might kneel
on cushions at the far end of the room; but boys
were expected to stand with their heads uncovered.
It is to be feared that true domestic
bliss was almost unknown in olden times.
Teachers were equally tyrannical, and it is a
matter of history that Roger Ascham, the tutor<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of Queen Elizabeth, used to "pinch, nip, and bob
[slap] the princess when she displeased him."</p>

<p>Some very curious facts relating to this subject
appear in the old Kirk-Session records. "David
Leyes, who struck his father," was, by a Kirk-Session
of St. Andrews, in 1574, sentenced to
appear before the congregation "bairheddit and
beirfuttit, upon the highest degree of the penitent
stuool, with a hammer in the ane hand and ane
stane in the uther hand, as the twa instruments he
mannesit his father,&mdash;with ane papir writin in
great letteris about his heid with these wordis,
'Behold the onnaturall Son, punished for putting
hand on his father, and dishonouring of God in
him.'" Nor was this deemed sufficient humiliation,
for the offender was afterwards made to
stand at the market cross two hours "in the jaggs,
and thereafter cartit through the haill toun." It
was also resolved that "if ever he offended father
or mother heireafter, the member of his body
quhairby he offendit sal be cuttit off from him,
be it tung, hand or futt without mercy, as
examples to utheris to abstein fra the lyke." At
Glasgow, in the year 1598, the Presbytery carefully
considered the conduct of a youth who had
passed his father "without lifting his bonnet."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>A servant in Wigtown, in 1649, was brought
before the magistrates for raising her hand and
abusing her mistress, and was ordered to stand a
full hour with the jougs round her neck.</p>

<p>At Rothesay, a woman gave the members of
the Kirk-Session a great deal of trouble through
departing from the path of sobriety. Persuasion
and rebuke were tried without avail. At last, in
the year 1661, the Session warned her that "if
hereafter she should be found drunk, she would
be put in the jouggs and have her dittay written
on her face."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Mr. James S. Thomson read a paper before the
Dumfries Antiquarian Society, supplying some
interesting glimpses of bygone times, furnished by
the Kirk-Session Records of Dumfries. Not the
least important information was that relating to
punishments of the past. It will not be without
interest to notice a few of the cases. In the year
1637, a man named Thomas Meik had been found
guilty of slandering Agnes Fleming, and he was
sentenced to stand for a certain time in the jougs
at the tron, and subsequently on his bare knees at
the market cross to ask her pardon.</p>

THE JOUGS, PRIORY CHURCH, BRIDLINGTON.</div>

<p>The case of Bessie Black was investigated, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
it was proved that for the third time she had
been found guilty of leaving the path of virtue,
and for her transgressions she was directed for six
Sabbaths to stand at the Cross in the jougs. In
another case it was proved that two servants had
been found guilty of scolding each other, and
sentence was given that they were "to be put
into the jougs presently." A curious sentence
was passed in the year 1644. A man and his
wife were ordered to stand at the Kirk-style with
the branks in their mouths.</p>

<p>Exposure of persons to the contempt of the
public was formerly a common form of punishment
in Scotland. Curious information bearing on
the subject may be gleaned from the old newspapers.
We gather from the columns of the
<i>Aberdeen Journal</i>, for the year 1759, particulars
of three women, named Janet Shinney, Margaret
Barrack, and Mary Duncan, who suffered by
being exposed in public. "Upon trial," it is
reported, "they were convicted, by their own
confessions, of being in the practice, for some time
past, of stealing and resetting tea and sugar, and
several other kinds of merchant's goods, from a
merchant in the town. And the Magistrates
have sentenced them to be carried to the Market<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Cross of Aberdeen, on Thursday the 31st [May,
1759], at twelve o'clock at noon, and to be tied to
a stake bareheaded for one hour by the
executioner, with a rope about each of their
necks, and a paper on
their breasts denoting
their crime; to be removed
to prison, and
taken down again on
Friday the 1st June at
twelve o'clock, and to
stand an hour at the
Market Cross in the
manner above mentioned;
and thereafter to be
transported through the
whole streets of the
town in a cart bareheaded
(for the greater
ignominy), with the executioner
and tuck of
drum, and to be banished
the burgh and liberties
in all time coming." In bygone ages, it was a
common custom to banish persons from towns for
immoral conduct. A woman at Dumfries, for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
example, was for a fourth lapse from virtue
sentenced "to be carted from the toun."</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Kirk-Session at Lesmahagow,
held in June, 1697, the case of a shepherd
who had shorn his sheep on the Parish Fast was
seriously discussed, with a view to severely
punishing him for the offence. A minute as
follows was passed: "The Session, considering
that there are several scandals of this nature
breaking forth, recommends to the bailie of the
bailerie of Lesmahagow to fix a pair of jougs at
the kirk door, that he may cause punish corporally
those who are not able to pay fines, and that
according to law."</p>

<p>A common word in Ayrshire for the jougs was
"bregan." In the accounts of the parish of
Mauchline is an entry as under:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">

JOUGS FROM THE OLD CHURCH OF CLOVA, FORFARSHIRE.</div>

<p class="noin">In Jamieson's "Dictionary" it is spelled "braidyeane."
Persons neglecting to attend church on
the Sunday were frequently put into the jougs.
Several cases of this kind might be cited, but
perhaps particulars of one will be sufficient. A
man named John Persene was brought before the
Kirk-Session of Galston, in 1651. He admitted<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
he had not been to church for the space of five
weeks. For thus neglecting to attend to the
ordinances, he was "injoyned to apier in the
public place of repentence, and there to be publicly
rebuked, with certificatione that if he be found to
be two Sabbaths together absent from the church
he shall be put in the breggan."</p>

THE JOUGS AT DUDDINGSTON.</div>

<p>In "Prehistoric Annals of Scotland," by Daniel
Wilson, <span class="smcapl">LL.D.</span> (London, 1863), there is a drawing
of a fine old pair of jougs, "found," says Wilson,
"imbedded in a venerable ash tree, recently
blown down, at the churchyard gate, Applegirth,
Dumfriesshire. The tree, which was of great
girth, is believed to have been upwards of three
hundred years old, and the jougs were completely
imbedded in its trunk, while the chain and staple
hung down within the decayed and hollow core."
The jougs belonging to the parish of Galashiels
are preserved at Abbotsford. At Merton, Berwickshire,
the jougs may be seen at the church.
The Fenwick jougs are still fastened to the
church wall, and the old Session Records of the
parish contain references to cases where persons
were ordered to "stand in the jougs from eight
till ten, and thence go to the place of repentence
within ye kirk." At the village of Kilmaurs,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Ayrshire, the jougs are attached to the old Tolbooth,
at the town of Kinross are fastened to the
market cross, and at Sanquhar they are in front
of the town hall.</p>

<p>We give three illustrations of the jougs. One
represents a very fine example, which may be seen
in the Priory Church of Bridlington, Yorkshire.
We believe that this is the first picture which has
been published of this interesting old-times relic.
It is referred to in the local guide book, but no
information is given as to when last used.</p>

<p>It is stated in the "History of Wakefield
Cathedral," by John W. Walker, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, that "an
old chain, leaded into the wall at the junction of
the north aisle with the tower in the interior of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the church, is said to have been used for the
purpose of fastening up persons who disturbed the
service." This may be safely assumed that formerly
the jougs were affixed at the end of the chain.</p>

<p>In the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland, Edinburgh, may be seen the jougs of
the old parish church of Clova, Forfarshire.
About a mile from Edinburgh is the charming
hamlet of Duddingston, and at the churchyard
gate are the jougs, which form a curious link
between the ruder customs of bygone ages and
the more refined life of modern times.</p>

ANGLO-SAXON PUNISHMENTS.</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stocks</span> were used, at an early period, as a
means of punishing breakers of the law.
The precise date when they were first employed
in this country is not known, but we may infer
from early medi&aelig;val illustrations that the stocks
were in general use amongst the Anglo-Saxons,
for they often figure in drawings of their public
places. The picture
we here give is from
the Harleian MSS.,
No. 65. The stocks
were usually placed
by the side of the
public road, at the
entrance of a town. It will be observed that two
offenders are fastened to the columns of a public
building by means of a rope or chain. It has
been suggested that it is a court-house.</p>

<div class="figl" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/040.png" width="309" height="110" alt="" title="" />
TAUNTING PERSONS IN THE STOCKS.</div>

<p>The "Cambridge Trinity College Psalter"&mdash;an
illuminated manuscript&mdash;presents some curious
illustrations of the manners of the earlier half of
the twelfth century. We give a reproduction of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
one of its quaint pictures. Two men are in the
stocks; one, it will be seen, is held by one leg
only, and the other by both, and a couple of
persons are taunting them in their time of trouble.</p>

<p>Stocks were not only used as a mode of punishment,
but as means of securing offenders. In
bygone times, every vill of common right was
compelled to erect a pair of stocks at its own
expense. The constable by common law might
place persons in the stocks to keep them in hold,
but not by way of punishment.</p>

<p>We gather from an Act passed during the reign
of Edward III., in the year 1351, and known as
the Second Statute of Labourers, that if artificers
were unruly they were liable to be placed in the
stocks. Some years later, namely, in 1376,
the Commons prayed that the stocks might be
established in every village. In 1405, an Act
was passed for every town and village to be<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
provided with a pair of stocks, so that a place
which had not this instrument of punishment and
detention was regarded as a hamlet. No village
was considered to be complete, or even worthy of
the name of village, without its stocks, so essential
to due order and government were they deemed
to be. A Shropshire historian, speaking of a
hamlet called Hulston, in the township of Middle,
in order, apparently, to prove that in calling the
place a hamlet and not a village he was speaking
correctly, remarks in proof of his assertion, that
Hulston did not then, or ever before, possess a
constable, a pound, or stocks.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde, who, in company with
Richard Pynsent, succeeded to Caxton's printing
business, in the year 1491, issued from his press
the play of "Hick Scorner," and in one of the
scenes the stocks are introduced. The works of
Shakespeare include numerous allusions to this
subject. Launce, in "The Two Gentlemen of
Verona" (IV. 4), says: "I have sat in the stocks
for puddings he hath stolen." In "All's Well that
Ends Well" (IV. 3), Bertram says: "Come, bring
forth this counterfeit module has deceived me, like
a double-meaning prophesier." Whereupon one<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the French lords adds: "Bring him forth; has
sat i' stocks all night, poor gallant knave."
Volumnia says of Coriolanus (V. 3):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"There's no man in the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More bound to's mother; yet here let me prate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one i' the stocks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Again, in the "Comedy of Errors" (III. 1),
Luce speaks of "a pair of stocks in the town,"
and in "King Lear" (II. 2), Cornwall, referring
to Kent, says:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Fetch forth the stocks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You stubborn ancient knave."<br /></span>

the correction of the servants.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

stocks. Says the poet:</p>

IN THE STOCKS, BY NESBIT.</div>

<p>We are enabled, by the kindness of Mr. Austin
Dobson, author of "Thomas Bewick and his<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Pupils," to reproduce from that work a picture of
the stocks, engraved by Charlton Nesbit for
Butler's "Hudibras," 1811.</p>

<p>Scottish history contains allusions to the
stocks; but in North Britain they do not appear
to have been so generally used as in England.
On the 24th August, 1623, a case occupied the
attention of the members of the Kirk-Session of
Kinghorn. It was proved that a man named
William Allan had been guilty of abusing his
wife on the Sabbath, and for the offence was
condemned to be placed twenty-four hours in the
stocks, and subsequently to stand in the jougs
two hours on a market day. It was further
intimated to him that if he again abused his wife,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he would be banished from the town. We give a
picture of the stocks formerly in the Canongate
Tolbooth, Edinburgh, and now in the Scottish
Antiquarian Museum.</p>

<p>It was enacted, in the year 1605, that every
person convicted of drunkenness should be fined
five shillings or spend six hours in the stocks, and
James I., in the year 1623, confirmed the Act.
Stocks were usually employed for punishing
drunkards, but drunkenness was by no means the
only offence for which they were brought into
requisition. Wood-stealers, or, as they were
styled, "hedge-tearers," were, about 1584, set in
the stocks two days in the open street, with the
stolen wood before them, as a punishment for a
second offence.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Vagrants were in former times
often put in the stocks, and Canning's "Needy
Knife-Grinder" was taken for one, and punished.</p>

STOCKS FROM THE CANONGATE TOLBOOTH.</div>

<p>In a valuable work mainly dealing with<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Devonshire, by A. H. A. Hamilton, entitled,
"Quarter Sessions from Queen Elizabeth to
Queen Anne," there is an important note on this
subject. "A favourite punishment," says Hamilton,
"for small offences, such as resisting a
constable, was the stocks. The offender had to
come into the church at morning prayer, and say
publicly that he was sorry, and was then set in
the stocks until the end of the evening prayer.
The punishment was generally repeated on the
next market day."</p>

<p>Tippling on a Sunday during public divine
service was in years agone a violation of the laws,
and frequently was the means of offenders being
placed in the stocks. In Sheffield, from a record
dated February 12th, 1790, we find that for
drinking in a public-house, during the time of
service in the church, nine men were locked in
the stocks. "Two boys," we find it is stated in
the same work, "were made to do penance in the
church for playing at trip during divine service,
by standing in the midst of the church with their
trip sticks erect."</p>

<p>Not far distant from Sheffield is the village of
Whiston, and here remain the old parish stocks
near to the church, and bear the date of 1786.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable person ever placed in
the stocks for drinking freely, but not wisely, was
Cardinal Wolsey. He was, about the year 1500,
the incumbent at Lymington, near Yeovil, and at
the village feast had overstepped the bounds of
moderation, and his condition being made known
to Sir Amias Poulett, <span class="smcapl">J.P.</span>, a strict moralist, he
was, by his instructions, humiliated by being
placed in the stocks. It was the general practice
in bygone days, not very far remote, for churchwardens
to visit the various public-houses during
the time of church service and see that no persons
were drinking. At Beverley, about 1853, the
representatives of the church, while on their
rounds, met in the streets a well-known local
character called Jim Brigham, staggering along
the street. The poor fellow was taken into
custody, and next day brought before the Mayor,
and after being severely spoken to about the sin
of Sunday tippling, he was sentenced to the
stocks for two hours. An eye-witness to Jim's
punishment says: "While he was in the stocks,
one of the Corporation officials placed in Jim's
hat a sheet of paper, stating the cause of his
punishment and its extent. A young man who
had been articled to a lawyer, but who was not<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
practising, stepped forward, and taking the paper
out, tore it into shreds, remarking it was no part
of Jim's sentence to be subjected to that additional
disgrace. The act was applauded by the onlookers.
One working-man who sympathised
with him, filled and lit a tobacco pipe, and placed
it in Jim's mouth; but it was instantly removed
by one of the constables, who considered it was a
most flagrant act, and one calling for prompt
interference on the part of the guardians of the
law." Brigham was the last person punished in
the stocks at Beverley. The stocks, which bear
the date 1789, were movable, and fitted into
sockets near the Market Cross. They are still
preserved in a chamber at St. Mary's in that
town. The Minster, Beverley, had also its stocks,
which are still preserved in the roof of that splendid
edifice.</p>

<p>The stocks were last used at Market Drayton
about sixty years ago. "It is related," says Mr.
Morris, "that some men, for imbibing too freely
and speaking unseemly language to parishioners,
as they were going to church on a Sunday morning,
were, on the following day, duly charged with
the offence and fined, the alternative being
confinement for four hours in the stocks. Two of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the men refused to pay the fine, and were
consequently put therein. The people flocked
around them, and, while some regaled them with
an ample supply of beer, others expressed their
sympathy in a more practical way by giving them
money, so that, when released, their heads and
their pockets were considerably heavier than they
had been on the previous Sunday." At Ellesmere,
the stocks, whipping-post, and pillory were
a combination of engines of punishment. The
former were frequently in use for the correction of
drunkards. A regular customer, we read, was
"honoured by a local poet with some impromptu
verses not unworthy of reproduction:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A tailor here! confined in stocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A prison made of wood&mdash;a&mdash;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and wailing to get out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But couldna' for his blood&mdash;a&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The pillory, it hung o'er his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The whipping-post so near&mdash;a&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crowd of people round about<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did at William laugh and jeer&mdash;a&mdash;'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">"The style was," it is said, "a sarcastic imitation
of 'William's' peculiar manner of speaking when
tipsy."</p>

<p>According to Mr. Christopher A. Markham,
in his notices of Gretton stocks, they "still<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
stand on the village green; they were made
to secure three men, and have shackles on the
post for whipping; they are in a good state of
repair. Joshua Pollard, of Gretton, was placed in
them, in the year 1857, for six hours, in default of
paying five shillings and costs for drunkenness."
In the following year a man was put in the stocks
for a similar offence. It is asserted that a man
was placed in the Aynhoe stocks in 1846 for
using bad language. Card-sharpers and the like
often suffered in the stocks. It appears from
the <i>Shrewsbury Chronicle</i> of May 1st, 1829, that
the punishment of the stocks was inflicted "at
Shrewsbury on three Birmingham youths for
imposing on 'the flats' of the town with the
games of 'thimble and pea' and 'prick the
garter.'"</p>

<p>A very late instance of a man being placed
in the stocks for gambling was recorded in the
<i>Leeds Mercury</i>, under date of April 14th, 1860.
"A notorious character," it is stated, "named
John Gambles, of Stanningley, having been
convicted some months ago for Sunday gambling,
and sentenced to sit in the stocks for six hours,
left the locality, returned lately, and suffered
his punishment by sitting in the stocks from<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
two till eight o'clock on Tuesday last." Several
writers on this old form of punishment regard
the foregoing as the latest instance of a person
being confined in the stocks; it is, however,
not the case, for one Mark Tuck, of Newbury,
Berkshire, in 1872, was placed in them. The
following particulars are furnished in <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, 4th series, vol. x., p. 6:&mdash;"A novel
scene was presented in the Butter and Poultry
Market, at Newbury, on Tuesday (June 11th,
1872) afternoon. Mark Tuck, a rag and bone
dealer, who for several years had been well known
in the town as a man of intemperate habits, and
upon whom imprisonment in Reading gaol had
failed to produce any beneficial effect, was fixed
in the stocks for drunkenness and disorderly
conduct in the Parish Church on Monday
evening. Twenty-six years had elapsed since the
stocks were last used, and their reappearance
created no little sensation and amusement, several
hundreds of persons being attracted to the spot
where they were fixed. Tuck was seated upon a
stool, and his legs were secured in the stocks at a
few minutes past one o'clock, and as the church
clock, immediately facing him, chimed each quarter,
he uttered expressions of thankfulness, and seemed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
anything but pleased at the laughter and derision
of the crowd. Four hours having passed, Tuck
was released, and by a little stratagem on the part
of the police, he escaped without being interfered
with by the crowd."</p>

<p>Attendance and repairing stocks formed quite
important items in old parish accounts. A few
entries drawn from the township account-books
of Skipton, may be reproduced as examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>During their later years, the Skipton stocks
were used almost solely on Sundays. A practice
prevailed at Skipton similar to the one we have
described at Beverley. "At a certain stage in the
morning service at the church," writes Mr.
Dawson, the local historian, "the churchwardens
of the town and country parishes withdrew, and
headed by the old beadle walked through the
streets of the town. If a person was found drunk
in the streets, or even drinking in one of the inns,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he was promptly escorted to the stocks, and impounded
for the remainder of the morning. An
imposing personage was the beadle. He wore
a cocked hat, trimmed, as was his official coat,
with gold, and he carried about with him in
majestic style a trident staff. 'A terror to evildoers'
he certainly was&mdash;at any rate, to those of
tender years."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The churchwardens not infrequently
partook of a slight refreshment during
their Sunday morning rounds, and we remember
seeing in the police reports of a Yorkshire town
that some highly respectable representatives of the
Church had been fined for drinking at an inn
during their tour of inspection.</p>

<p>"At Bramhall, Cheshire," says Mr. Alfred
Burton, to whom we are indebted for several
illustrations and many valuable notes in this book,
"the stocks were perfect till 1887, when the leg-stones
were unfortunately taken away, and cannot
now be found. Thomas Leah, about 1849, was
the last person put into them. He went to the
constable and asked to be placed in the stocks, a
request that was granted, and he remained there
all night. On the 9th August, 1822, two women
were incarcerated in the stocks in the market<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
place at Stockport, for three hours, one for getting
drunk, the other for gross and deliberate scandal."</p>

<p>We give an illustration from a recent photograph
by Mr. A. Whitford Anderson, of Watford,
of the stocks and whipping-post at Aldbury,
Hertfordshire. It presents one of the best
pictures of these old-time relics which has come
under our notice. We have no desire for the
stocks and lash to be revived, but we hope these
obsolete engines of punishments will long remain
linking the past with the present.</p>

<p>In closing this chapter we must not omit to
state that in the olden time persons refusing to
assist in getting in the corn or hay harvest were
liable to be imprisoned in the stocks. At the
Northamptonshire Quarter Sessions held in 1688,
the time was fixed at two days and one night.</p>

<h2>The Drunkard's Cloak.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Several</span> historians, dealing with the social
life of England in bygone times, have
described the wearing of a barrel after the manner
of a cloak as a general mode of punishing
drunkards, in force during the Commonwealth.
There appears to be little foundation for the
statement, and, after careful consideration, we
have come to the conclusion that this mode
of punishment was, as regards this country,
confined to Newcastle-on-Tyne.</p>

<p>In the year 1655 was printed in London a
work entitled, "England's Grievance Discovered
in Relation to the Coal Trade," by Ralph
Gardner, of Chirton, in the county of Northumberland,
Gent. The book is dedicated to
"Oliver, Lord Protector." Gardner not only
gave a list of grievances, but suggested measures
to reform them. It will be gathered from the
following proposed remedy that he was not any
advocate of half measures in punishing persons
guilty of offences. He suggested that a law be<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
created for death to those who should commit
perjury, forgery, or bribery.</p>

<p>More than one writer has said that Gardner
was executed in 1661, at York, for coining, but
there is not any truth in the statement. We
have proof that he was conducting his business
after the year in which it is stated that he suffered
death at the hands of the public executioner.</p>

<p>Gardner, in his work, gave depositions of
witnesses to support his charges against "the
tyrannical oppression of the magistrates of Newcastle-on-Tyne."
"John Willis, of Ipswich," he
writes, "upon his oath said, that he, and this
deponent, was in Newcastle six months ago, and
there he saw one Ann Bridlestone drove through
the streets by an officer of the same corporation,
holding a rope in his hand, the other end fastened
to an engine called the branks, which is like a
crown, it being of iron, which was musled over
the head and face, with a great gag or tongue of
iron forced into her mouth, which forced the
blood out; and that is the punishment which the
magistrates do inflict upon chiding and scoulding
women; and he hath often seen the like done to
others."</p>

<div class="figr" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/045.png" width="311" height="193" alt="" title="" />
BRANK AND DRUNKARD'S CLOAK, NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.</div>

<p>"He, this deponent, further affirms, that he<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
hath seen men drove up and down the streets,
with a great tub or barrel opened in the sides,
with a hole in one end to put through their heads,
and so cover their shoulders and bodies, down to
the small of their legs, and then close the same,
called the new-fashioned cloak, and so make
them march to the view of all beholders; and
this is their punishment for drunkards and the
like."</p>

<p>Several other forms of punishment are
mentioned by Gardner. Drunkards, we gather,
for the first offence were fined five shillings, to be
given to the poor, or in default of payment within
a week, were set in the stocks for six hours. For
the second offence they had to be bound for good<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
behaviour. Scolds had to be ducked over head
and ears in a ducking-stool.</p>

<p>"I was certainly informed," wrote Gardner,
"by persons of worth, that the punishments
above are but gentle admonitions to what they
knew was acted by two magistrates of Newcastle:
one for killing a poor workman of his own, and
being questioned for it, and condemned, compounded
with King James for it, paying to a
Scotch lord his weight in gold and silver, every
seven years or thereabouts, etc. The other
magistrate found a poor man cutting a few horse
sticks in his wood, for which offence he bound
him to a tree, and whipt him to death."</p>

<p>The Rev. John Brand, in 1789, published his
"History of Newcastle-on-Tyne," and reproduced
in it Gardner's notice of the drunkard's cloak.
Brand gives a picture of the cloak, and Mr.
J. R. Boyle, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, a leading authority on
North Country bibliography, tells us that he
believes it to be the first pictorial representation
of the cloak. Our illustration is from Richardson's
"Local Historian's Table Book." Mr.
Walter Scott, publisher, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
has kindly lent us the block.</p>

<p>Dr. T. N. Brushfield, to whom we are under an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
obligation for several of the facts included in this
chapter, read before the British Arch&aelig;ological
Association, February 15th, 1888, a paper on this
theme. "It is rather remarkable," said Dr.
Brushfield, "that no allusion to this punishment
is to be found in the Newcastle Corporation
accounts or other local documents." We have
reproduced from Gardner's volume the only
testimony we possess of the administration of the
punishment in England. There are many traces
of this kind of cloak on the continent. It is
noticed in "Travels in Holland," by Sir William
Brereton, under date of May 29th, 1634, as seen
at Delft. John Evelyn visited Delft, on August
17th, 1641, and writes that in the Senate House
"hangs a weighty vessel of wood, not unlike a
butter-churn, which the adventurous woman that
hath two husbands at one time is to wear on her
shoulders, her head peeping out at the top only,
and so led about the town, as a penance for her
incontinence." Samuel Pepys has an entry in his
diary respecting seeing a similar barrel at the
Hague, in the year 1660. We have traces of this
mode of punishment in Germany. John Howard,
in his work entitled "The State of Prisons in
England and Wales," 1784, thus writes: "Denmark.&mdash;Some<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
(criminals) of the lower sort, as
watchmen, coachmen, etc., are punished by being
led through the city in what is called 'The
Spanish Mantle.' This is a kind of heavy vest,
something like a tub, with an aperture for the
head, and irons to enclose the neck. I measured
one at Berlin, 1ft. 8in. in diameter at the top, 2ft.
11in. at the bottom, and 2ft. 11in. high....
This mode of punishment is particularly dreaded,
and is one cause that night robberies are never
heard of in Copenhagen."</p>

<div class="figr" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/046.png" width="192" height="245" alt="" title="" />
PUNISHMENT OF A DRUNKARD.</div>

<p>We may safely conclude that the drunkard's
cloak was introduced into Newcastle from the
Continent. The author of a paper published in
1862, under the title of "A Look at the Federal
Army," after speaking of crossing the Susquehanna,
has some remarks about punishments. "I was,"
says the writer, "extremely amused to see a
'rare' specimen of Yankee invention, in the shape
of an original method of punishment drill. One
wretched delinquent was gratuitously framed in
oak, his head being thrust through a hole cut
in one end of a barrel, the other end of which
had been removed; and the poor fellow 'loafed'
about in the most disconsolate manner, looking
for all the world like a half-hatched chicken.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Another defaulter had heavy weights fastened to
his wrists, his hands and feet being chained together."
In conclusion, we are told that the
punishments were as various as the crimes, but
the man in the pillory-like barrel was deemed the
most ludicrous.</p>

<p>The early English settlers in America introduced
many English customs into the country.
The pillory, stocks, ducking-stool, etc., were
frequently employed. Drunkards were punished
in various ways; sometimes they had to wear a
large "D" in red, which was painted on a board<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
or card, and suspended by a string round the
neck.</p>

<p>At Haddon, Derbyshire, is a curious relic of
bygone times, consisting of an iron handcuff or
ring, fastened to some woodwork in the banqueting
hall. If a person refused to drink the liquor
assigned to him, or committed an offence against
the convivial customs at the festive gatherings for
which this ancient mansion was so famous, his
wrist was locked in an upright position in the iron
ring, and the liquor he had declined, or a quantity
of cold water, was poured down the sleeve of his
doublet.</p>

<h2>Whipping and Whipping-Posts.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Anglo-Saxons whipped prisoners with a
whip of three cords, knotted at the end.
It was not an uncommon practice for mistresses
to whip, or have their servants whipped, to death.
William of Malmesbury relates a story to the
effect that when King Ethelred was a child, he
on one occasion displeased his mother, and she,
not having a whip at hand, flogged him with
some candles until he was nearly insensible with
pain. "On this account," so runs the story, "he
dreaded candles during the rest of his life to such
a degree that he would never suffer the light of
them to be introduced in his presence." During
the Saxon epoch, flogging was generally adopted
as means of punishing persons guilty of offences,
whether slight or serious.</p>

<p>For a long time in our history, payments for
using the lash formed important items in the
municipal accounts of towns or parish accounts of
villages.</p>

<p>Before the monasteries were dissolved, the poor<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
were relieved at them. No sooner had they
passed away than the vagrants became a nuisance,
and steps were taken to put a stop to begging;
indeed, prior to this period attempts had been
made to check wandering vagrants. They were
referred to in the "Statute of Labourers," passed
in the year 1349. Not a few enactments were
made to keep down vagrancy. In the reign of
Edward VI., in 1547, an Act was passed, from
which it appears "that any person who had
offered them work which they refused, was
authorised to brand them on the breast with a V,
hold them in slavery for two years, feed them
during that period on bread and water, and hire
them out to others." The Act failed on account
of its severity, and was repealed in 1549.</p>

<p>It was in the reign of Henry VIII., and in the
year 1530, that the famous Whipping Act was
instituted, directing that vagrants were to be
carried to some market town or other place, "and
there tied to the end of a cart naked, and beaten
with whips throughout such market town, or other
place, till the body shall be bloody by reason of
such whipping." Vagrants, after being whipped,
had to take an oath that they would return to
their native places, or where they had last dwelt<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
for three years. Various temporary modifications
were made in this Act, but it remained in force
until the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, when some important alterations were
made. Persons were not to be publicly whipped
naked, as previously, but from the middle upwards,
and whipped until the body should be
bloody. It was at this time that the whipping-post
was substituted for the cart. Whipping-posts
soon became plentiful. John Taylor, "the water
poet," in one of his works, published in 1630,
adverts to them as follows:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In London, and within a mile, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are jails or prisons full eighteen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sixty whipping-posts and stocks and cages."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="figr" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/047.png" width="266" height="407" alt="" title="" />
WALTHAM ABBEY WHIPPING-POST AND STOCKS.</div>

<p>We give an illustration of the Waltham Abbey
Whipping-Post and Stocks, as they appeared
when they stood within the old wooden market-house,
which was pulled down in 1853. The
post bears on it the date 1598, and is 5 feet
9 inches high; it is strongly made of oak, with
iron clasps for the hands when employed as a
whipping-post, and for the feet when used as the
stocks. It is rather more elaborate than others
which have come under our notice. It will be
observed the seat for the culprits placed in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
stocks was beside one of the immense oak
pillars of the market-house. They are now
placed with the remains of the Pillory at the
entrance of the schoolroom, on the south-west
side of the church.</p>

<p>Some of the authorities regarded with greater
favour the punishment at the whipping-post than
at the cart tail. An old writer deals at some
length with the benefit of the former. Says he:
"If to put in execution the laws of the land be of
any service to the nation, which few, I think, will
deny, the benefits of the whipping-post must be
very apparent, as being a necessary instrument to
such an execution. Indeed, the service it does
to a country is inconceivable. I, myself, know a
man who had proceeded to lay his hand upon a
silver spoon with a design to make it his own, but
on looking round, and seeing the whipping-post
in his way, he desisted from the theft. Whether
he suspected that the post would impeach him or
not, I will not pretend to determine; some folks
were of opinion that he was afraid of <i>habeas
corpus</i>. It is likewise an infallible remedy for all
lewd and disorderly behaviour, which the chairman
at sessions generally employs to restrain; nor
is it less beneficial to the honest part of mankind<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
than the dishonest, for though it lies immediately
in the high road to the gallows, it has stopped
many an adventurous young man in his progress
thither." The records of the Worcester Corporation
contain many references to old-time
punishments. In the year 1656 was made in the
bye-law book a note of the fact that for some
years past a want has been felt "for certain
instruments for applying to the execution of
justice upon offenders, namely, the pillory, whipping-post,
and gum-stoole." The Chamberlain
was directed to obtain the same. We gather from
the proceedings of the Doncaster Town Council
that on the 5th of May, 1713, an order was made
for the erection of a whipping-post, to be set
up at the Stocks, Butcher-Cross, for punishing
vagrants and sturdy beggars.</p>

<p>Notices of whipping sometimes appear in old
church books. At Kingston-on-Thames, under
date of September 8th, 1572, it is recorded in the
parish register as follows: "This day in this towne
was kept the sessions of Gayle Delyverye, and ther
was hanged vj. persons, and xvj. taken for roges
and vagabonds, and whypped aboyt the market-place,
and brent in the ears."</p>

<p>At the Quarter Sessions in Devonshire, held at<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Easter, 1598, it was ordered that the mothers of
illegitimate children be whipped. The reputed
fathers had to undergo a like punishment. A
very strange order was made in the same county
during the Commonwealth, and it was to the
effect that every woman who had been the mother
of an illegitimate child, and had not been previously
punished, be committed for trial. Mr.
Hamilton, in his work on the "Quarter Sessions
from Queen Elizabeth to Queen Anne," has many
curious notes on the subject. The Scotch pedlars
and others who wended their way to push their
trade in the West of England, ran a great risk of
being whipped. At the Midsummer Sessions, in
the year 1684, information was given to the court
showing that certain Scotch pedlars, or other
petty chapmen, were in the habit of selling their
goods to the "greate damage and hindrance of
shopp keepers." The Court passed measures for
the protection of the local tradesmen, and directed
the petty constables to apprehend the strangers,
and without further ceremony to strip them
naked, and whip them, or cause them to be
openly flogged, and sent away.</p>

<p>The churchwardens' accounts of Barnsley contain
references to the practice of whipping.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

<p>The notorious Judge Jeffreys, on one occasion,
in sentencing a woman to be whipped, said:
"Hangman, I charge you to pay particular
attention to this lady. Scourge her soundly,
man; scourge her till her blood runs down! It
is Christmas, a cold time for madam to strip.
See that you warm her shoulders thoroughly!"</p>

<p>At Worcester, in 1697, a new whipping-post
was erected in the Corn Market, at a cost of 8s.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
"Men and women," says a local historian, "were
whipped here promiscuously in public till the
close of the last century, if not later. Fourpence
was the old charge for whipping male and female
rogues."</p>

<p>The next note on whipping is drawn from the
church register of Burnham, Bucks, and is one of
several similar entries: "Benjamin Smat, and his
wife and three children, vagrant beggars; he of
middle stature, but one eye, was this 28th day of
September, 1699, with his wife and children,
openly whipped at Boveney, in the parish of
Burnham, in the county of Bucks, according to ye
laws. And they are assigned to pass forthwith
from parish to parish by ye officers thereof the
next direct way to the parish of St. [Se]pulchers,
Lond., where they say they last inhabited three
years. And they are limited to be at St. [Se]pulch
within ten days next ensuing. Given
under our hands and seals, Will. Glover, Vicar of
Burnham, and John Hunt, Constable of Boveney."
In some instances we gather from the
entries in the parish registers, after punishing the
vagrants in their own parish, the authorities
recommended them to the tender mercy of other
persons in whose hands they might fall.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>At Durham, in the year 1690, a married woman
named Eleanor Wilson, was publicly whipped in
the market-place, between the hours of eleven
and twelve o'clock, for being drunk on Sunday,
April 20th.</p>

<p>Insane persons did not escape the lash. In
the constable's accounts of Great Staughtan,
Huntingdonshire, is an item:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>In 1764, we gather from the <i>Public Ledger</i>
that a woman, who is described as "an old
offender," was conveyed in a cart from Clerkenwell
Bridewell to Enfield, and publicly whipped
at the cart's tail by the common hangman, for
cutting down and destroying wood in Enfield
Chase. She had to undergo the punishment
three times.</p>

<p>Persons obtaining goods under false pretences
were frequently flogged. In 1769, at Nottingham,
a young woman, aged nineteen, was found<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
guilty of this crime, and was, by order of the
Court of Quarter Sessions, stripped to the waist
and publicly whipped on market-day in the
market-place. In the following year, a female
found guilty of stealing a handkerchief from a
draper's shop, was tied to the tail of a cart and
whipped from Weekday-Cross to the Malt-Cross.
It was at Nottingham, a few years prior to this
time, that a soldier was severely punished for
drinking the Pretender's health. The particulars
are briefly told as follows in <i>Adams's Weekly
Courant</i> for Wednesday, July 20th, to Wednesday,
July 27th, 1737: "Friday last, a dragoon,
belonging to Lord Cadogan's Regiment, at
Nottingham, received 300 lashes, and was to
receive 300 more at Derby, and to be drum'd
out of the Regiment with halter about his neck,
for drinking the Pretender's health."</p>

<p>Whipping at Wakefield appears to have been a
common punishment. Payments like the following
frequently occur in the constable's accounts:</p>

<p>A fire occurred at Olney in 1783, and during<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the confusion a man stole some ironwork. The
crime was detected, and the man was tried and
sentenced to be whipped at the cart's tail. Cowper,
the poet, was an eye-witness to the
carrying out of the sentence, and in a letter to
the Rev. John Newton gives an amusing account
of it. "The fellow," wrote Cowper, "seemed to
show great fortitude; but it was all an imposition.
The beadle who whipped him had his left hand
filled with red ochre, through which, after every
stroke, he drew the lash of the whip, leaving the
appearance of a wound upon the skin, but in
reality not hurting him at all. This being
perceived by the constable, who followed the
beadle to see that he did his duty, he (the
constable) applied the cane, without any such
management or precaution, to the shoulders of
the beadle. The scene now became interesting
and exciting. The beadle could by no means be
induced to strike the thief hard, which provoked
the constable to strike harder; and so the double
flogging continued, until a lass of Silver End,
pitying the pityful beadle, thus suffering under
the hands of the pityless constable, joined the
procession, and placing herself immediately behind
the constable, seized him by his capillary club,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and pulling him backward by the same, slapped
his face with Amazonian fury. This concentration
of events has taken up more of my paper than I
intended, but I could not forbear to inform you
how the beadle thrashed the thief, the constable
the beadle, and the lady the constable, and how
the thief was the only person who suffered
nothing." It will be gathered from the foregoing
letter that the severity of the whipping depended
greatly on the caprice of the man who administered
it.</p>

<p>A statute, in 1791, expressly forbade the
whipping of female vagrants. This was certainly
a much needed reform.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Carter Hall, born in the year
1800, in his interesting book entitled "Retrospect
of a Long Life" (1883), relates that more than
once he saw the cruel punishment inflicted.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, 1822, a man was whipped
through the streets of Glasgow by the hangman
for taking part in a riot. He was the last person
to undergo public whipping at the cart's tail in
Glasgow.</p>

COLESHILL PILLORY, WHIPPING-POST,
AND STOCKS.</div>

<p>At Coleshill are standing a whipping-post,
pillory and stocks, and as might be expected they
attract a good deal of attention from the visitors<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to this quiet Midland town. Several writers have
stated that this is the only whipping-post remaining
in this country; this is, however, a mistake,
as we have shown in the present chapter. We
have not been able to discover when last used.
Our illustration is from a
carefully executed drawing
made some years ago.</p>

WHIPPING-POST, KIRTON-IN-LINDSEY.</div>

<p>The old town of Kirton-in-Lindsey,
Lincolnshire,
in bygone times was a
place of importance, and
amongst the names of those
who have held its manor
is that of Piers Gaveston,
the favourite of Edward
II. Near the modern
police station is a post on
which are irons, enabling
it to be used as a whipping-post
and stocks. No references relating to it
can be found in the local old-time accounts or
other documents. Old folk say that in years
agone people were detained at the post by means
of the irons, but no instances are remembered
of a whip being employed.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>It was formerly the custom in London and
other places, at the time of executions, for parents
to whip their children, so as to impress upon their
minds the awful lessons of the gallows. Executions
were very often occurring, for people were
hanged for trifling offences. Down to the year
1808, the crime of
stealing from the person
above the value
of a shilling was punishable
with death.
Children must have
had a hard time of
it, and been frequently
flogged.</p>

<p>Whipping servants
was a common practice
in the olden
time. Pepys and
other old writers
make note of it.</p>

<p>The well-known "Diary of a Lady of Quality"
contains some interesting glimpses of old days and
ways. Under date of January 30th, 1760, Lady
Francis Pennoyer, of Bullingham Court, Herefordshire,
refers to one of her maids speaking in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
housekeeper's room about a matter that was not to
the credit of the family. My lady felt that there
was truth in what the girl said, but it was not in her
place to speak, and her ladyship resolved to make
her know and keep her place. "She hath a pretty
face," says the diarist, "and should not be too
ready to speak ill of those above her in station.
I should be very sorry to turn her adrift upon the
world, and she hath but a poor home. Sent for
her to my room, and gave her choice, either to
be well whipped, or to leave the house instantly.
She chose wisely, I think, and, with many tears,
said I might do what I liked. I bade her attend
my chamber to-morrow at twelve." Next day
her ladyship writes in her diary: "Dearlove, my
maid, came to my room, as I bade her. I bade
her fetch the rod from what was my mother-in-law's
rod-closet, and kneel and ask pardon, which
she did with tears. I made her prepare, and I
whipped her well. The girl's flesh is plump and
firm, and she is a cleanly person&mdash;such a one, not
excepting my own daughters, who are thin, and
one of them, Charlotte, rather sallow, as I have
not whipped for a long time. She hath never
been whipped before, she says, since she was a
child (what can her mother and late lady have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
been about, I wonder?), and she cried out a
great deal." Children and servants appear to
have been frequently flogged at Bullingham
Court, both by its lord and lady. In other
homes similar practices prevailed.</p>

<h2>Public Penance.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Church</span> discipline in the olden days caused
the highest and lowest in the land to
perform penance in public. A notable instance
of a king subjecting himself to this humiliating
form of punishment is that of Henry II. The
story of the King's quarrels with Becket, and of
his unfortunate expression which led four knights
to enact a tragic deed in Canterbury Cathedral, is
familiar to the reader of history. After the foul
murder of Becket had been committed, the King
was in great distress, and resolved to do penance
at the grave of the murdered Archbishop.
Mounted on his horse, he rode to Canterbury,
and on coming in sight of the Cathedral, he
dismounted, and walked barefooted to Becket's
shrine. He spent the day in prayer and fasting,
and at night watched the relics of the saint. He
next, in presence of the monks, disrobed himself,
and presented his bare shoulders for them to
lash.</p>

<p>At Canossa, in the winter of 1077, was performed
a most degrading act of penance by<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Emperor Henry IV. of Germany. He had been
excommunicated by Pope Gregory VII., and had
suffered much on that account. He resolved to
see the Pope, and, if possible, obtain absolution.
The Emperor made a long and toilsome journey
in the cold, in company with his loving wife
Bertha, his infant son, and only one knight. The
Pope refused to see the Emperor until he had
humbled himself at the gates of the castle. "On
a dreary winter morning," say Baring-Gould and
Gilman, in their "History of Germany," "with
the ground deep in snow, the King, the heir of a
line of emperors, was forced to lay aside every
mark of royalty, was clad in the thin white dress
of the penitent, and there fasting, he awaited the
pleasure of the Pope in the castle yard. But the
gates did not unclose. A second day he stood,
cold, hungry, and mocked by vain hope." On
the close of the third day, we are told that he was
received and pardoned by the Pope.</p>

<p>The romantic story of Eleanor Cobham, first
mistress and afterwards wife of Humphrey, Duke
of Gloucester, is one of considerable interest in
illustrating the strange beliefs of the olden times.
The Duchess was tried in the year 1441, for
treason and witchcraft. It transpired that two<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of her accomplices had made, by her direction, a
waxen image of the reigning monarch, Henry VI.
They had placed it before a slow fire, believing that
the King's life would waste away as the figure
did. In the event of Henry's death, the Duke
of Gloucester, as the nearest heir to the house of
Lancaster, would have been crowned king. On
the 9th November, sentence was pronounced upon
the Duchess: it was to the effect that she perform
public penance in three open places in London,
and end her days in prison in the Isle of Man.
The manner of her doing penance was as follows:
"On Monday, the 13th, she came by water from
Westminster, and landing at Temple Bridge,
walked at noon-day through Fleet Street, bearing
a waxen taper of two pounds weight, to St. Paul's,
where she offered it at the high altar. On the
Wednesday following, she landed at the Old
Swan, and passed through Bride Street, Gracechurch
Street, and to Leadenhall, and at Cree
Church, near Aldgate, made her second offering.
On the ensuing Friday she was put on shore at
Queenhithe, whence she proceeded to St.
Michael's Church, Cornhill, and so completed her
penance. In each of these processions her head
was covered only by a kerchief; her feet were<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
bare; scrolls, containing a narrative of her crime,
were affixed to her white dress; and she was
received and attended by the Mayor, Sheriff, and
Companies of London."</p>

<p>The historian, biographer, poet, playwright, and
story-teller have all related details of the career of
Jane Shore. A sad tale it is, but one which has
always been popular both with gentle and simple.
It is not necessary to relate here at length the
story of her life. She was born in London, was a
woman of considerable personal charms, and could
do what few ladies of her time were able to
accomplish&mdash;namely, read well and write. When
some sixteen or seventeen years of age, she
married William Shore, a goldsmith and banker,
of Lombard Street. She lived with her husband
seven years, but about 1470, left him to become
one of the mistresses of Edward IV. Her
beauty, wit, and pleasant behaviour rendered her
popular at Court. The King died in 1483, and
within two months she was charged by Richard
III. with sorcery and witchcraft, but the charges
could not be sustained. Her property, equal to
about &pound;20,000 at the present time, was taken from
her by the King. He afterwards caused her to
be brought before the Ecclesiastical Court and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
tried for incontinence, and for the crime she had
to do penance in the streets of London. Perhaps
we cannot do better than quote Rowe's drama
to relate this part of her story:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Submissive, sad, and lonely was her look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A burning taper in her hand she bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her shoulders, carelessly confused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loose neglect her lovely tresses hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her cheek a faintish flush was spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeble she seemed, and sorely smit with pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, barefoot as she trod the flinty pavement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her footsteps all along were marked with blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet silent still she passed, and unrepining;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her streaming eyes bent ever on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except when, in some bitter pang of sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven, she seemed, in fervent zeal to raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beg that mercy man denied her here.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We need not go into details respecting her life
from this time, but briefly state that it is a
popular error to suppose that she was starved in
a ditch, and that the circumstance gave rise to the
name of a part of London known as Shoreditch.
The black-letter ballad in the Pepys collection,
which makes Jane Shore die of hunger after doing
penance, and a man suffer death on the gallows
for giving her bread, is without foundation. She
died about 1533 or 1534, when she was upwards
of eighty years of age. It is asserted that<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
she strewed flowers at the funeral of Henry VII.</p>

<p>A curious act of penance was performed in
Hull, in the year 1534, by the Vicar of North
Cave. He appears to have made a study of the
works of the Reformers who had settled in
Antwerp, and sent over their books to England.
In a sermon preached in the Holy Trinity
Church, Hull, he advocated their teaching, and
for this he was tried for heresy and convicted.
He recanted, and, as an act of penance, one
Sunday walked round the church barefooted, with
only his shirt on, and carrying a large faggot in
his hand to represent the punishment he deserved.
On the next market-day, in a similar manner, he
walked round the market-place of the town.</p>

<p>In the year 1602, a man named Cuthbert
Pearson Foster, residing in the parish of St.
Nicholas, Durham, was brought before the
Ecclesiastical Court, charged with "playing at
nine-holes upon the Sabbath day in time of divine
service," and was condemned to stand once in the
parish church during service, clad in a white
sheet. In the following year, the four churchwardens&mdash;Rowland
Swinburn, William Harp,
Richard Surtees, and Cuthbert Dixon, men
esteemed in Durham, and holding good positions&mdash;were<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
found guilty and admonished for a serious
breach of duty, "for not searching who was
absent from the church on the Sabbath and
festive days, for it is credibly reported that
drinking, banqueting, and playing at cards, and
other lawless games, are used in their parish
in alehouses, and they never made search
thereof."</p>

<p>Of persons in the humble ranks of life who
have performed public penance in white sheets in
churches, for unchastity, there are numerous
entries in parish registers. For immorality,
prior to marriage, man and wife were sometimes
obliged to do penance. The Rev. Dr. J. Charles
Cox found particulars of a case of this kind
recorded in the Wooley MSS., in the British
Museum, where a married couple, in the reign of
James I., performed penance in Wirksworth
Church.</p>

<p>In parish registers are records like the following,
drawn from the Roxby (Lincolnshire) parish
register: "Memorandum.&mdash;Michael Kirby and
Dixon, Wid. had 2 Bastard Children, one in 1725,
ye other in 1727, for which they did publick
pennance in our P'ish Church." "Michael
Kirby and Anne Dixon, both together did<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
publick penance in our Parish Churche, Feb. ye
25th, 1727, for adultery."</p>

<p>A memorandum in the parish register of North
Aston, Oxfordshire, states: "That Mr. Cooper
sent in a form of penance by Mr. Wakefield, of
Deddington, that Catherine King should do
penance in ye parish church of North Aston, ye
sixth day of March, 1740, and accordingly she
did. Witness, Will Vaughan, Charles May, John
Baillis, Churchwardens." We learn from the
same records that another person, who had
become a mother before she was made a wife, left
the parish to avoid doing public penance.</p>

<p>In the old churchwardens' accounts of Wakefield,
are several items bearing on this subject,
and amongst the number are the following:</p>

<p>"On February 27th, 1815," says Mr. John W.
Walker, "William Hepworth, a shoemaker, did
penance in the Parish Church for defaming the
character of an old woman named Elizabeth
Blacketer. They both lived in Cock and Swan
Yard, Westgate, and the suit was carried on by
one George Robinson, an attorney, out of spite to
the cobbler."</p>

<p>"On Sunday, August 25th, 1850, a penance
was performed in the Parish Church, by sentence
of the Ecclesiastical Court, on a person who had
defamed the character of a lady in Wakefield.
A recantation was repeated by the penitent
after the Vicar, and then signed by the interested
parties."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The historian of Cleveland, Mr. George Markham
Tweddell, furnishes us with a copy of a
document enjoining penance to be performed in
1766, by James Beadnell, of Stokesley, in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
diocese of York, tailor: "The said James Beadnell
shall be present in the Parish Church of
Stokesley, aforesaid, upon Sunday, being the
fifth, twelfth, and nineteenth day of January
instant, in the time of Divine service, between
the hours of ten and eleven in the forenoon of the
same day, in the presence of the whole congregation
then assembled, being barehead, barefoot,
and barelegged, having a white sheet wrapped
about him from the shoulder to the feet, and
a white wand in his hand, where, immediately
after the reading of the Gospel, he shall stand
upon some form or seat, before the pulpit or
place where the minister readeth prayers, and say
after him as forthwith: 'Whereas, I, good people,
forgetting my duty to Almighty God, have
committed the detestable sin of adultery with
Ann Andrewes, and thereby have provoked the
heavy wrath of God against me to the great
danger of my soul and evil example of others. I
do earnestly repent, and am heartily sorry for the
same, desiring Almighty God, for the merits of
Jesus Christ, to forgive me both this and all
other my offences, and also ever hereafter so to
assist me with His Holy Spirit, that I never fall
into the like offence again; and for that end and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
purpose, I desire you all here present to pray
for me, saying, "Our Father, which art in heaven,"
and so forth.'"</p>

<p>Towards the close of the last century, it
was the practice of women doing penance at
Poulton Church, Lancashire, to pass along the
aisles barefooted, clothed in a white sheet, and
having in each hand a lighted candle. The
last time the ceremony was performed, we are
told, the cries of the poor girl melted the heart
of the people, and the well-disposed raised a
clamour against it, and caused the practice to be
discontinued.</p>

<p>The Rev. Thomas Jackson, the popular
Wesleyan minister, was born at Sancton, a village
on the Yorkshire Wolds, in 1783. Writing of
his earlier years spent in his native village, he
describes two cases of public penance which he
witnessed. "A farmer's son," says Mr. Jackson,
"the father of an illegitimate child, came into
church at the time of divine service, on the Lord's
day, covered with a sheet, having a white wand in
his hand; he walked barefoot up the aisle, stood
over against the desk where the prayers were
read, and then repeated a confession at the
dictation of the clergyman; after which he walked<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
out of the church. The other case was that of a
young woman,</p>

<div class="center">'Who bore unhusbanded a mother's name.'</div>

<p class="noin">She also came into the church barefoot, covered
with a sheet, bearing a white wand, and went
through the same ceremony. She had one
advantage which the young man had not. Her
long hair so completely covered her face that not
a feature could be seen. In a large town, few
persons would have known who she was, but in a
small village every one is known, and no public
delinquent can escape observation, and the censure
of busy tongues. These appear to have been
the last cases of the kind that occurred at
Sancton. The sin was perpetuated, but the
penalty ceased; my father observed that the rich
offenders evaded the law, and then the authorities
could not for shame continue to inflict its penalty
upon the labouring classes."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In the month of April, 1849, penance was
performed at Ditton Church, Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>The Church of East Clevedon, Somersetshire,
on July 30th, 1882, was the scene of a man performing
penance in public, and the act attracted
much attention in the newspapers of the time.</p>

<h2>The Repentance Stool.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> records of church-life in Scotland, in
bygone times, contain many allusions to
the repentance stool. A very good specimen of
this old-time relic may be seen in the Museum of
the Society of Antiquaries, at Edinburgh. It is
from the church of Old Greyfriars, of Edinburgh.
In the same museum is a sackcloth, or gown of
repentance, formerly used at the parish church of
West Calder.</p>

<p>Persons guilty of adultery were frequently
placed on the repentance stool, and rebuked
before the congregation assembled for public
worship. The ordeal was a most trying one.
Severe laws have been passed in Scotland to
check adultery. "In the First Book of Discipline,"
says the Rev. Charles Rogers, <span class="smcapl">LL.D.</span>, "the
Reformers demanded that adulterers should be
put to death. Their desire was not fully complied
with, but in 1563 Parliament enacted that
'notour adulterers'&mdash;meaning those of whose
illicit connection a child had been born&mdash;should<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
be executed." Dr. Rogers and other authorities
assert that the penalty was occasionally inflicted.</p>

REPENTANCE STOOL, FROM OLD GREYFRIARS, EDINBURGH.</div>

<p>Paul Methven, minister at Jedburgh, in the
year 1563, admitted that he had been guilty of
adultery. The General Assembly conferred with
the Lords of the Council respecting his conduct.
Three years later, we are told, that he was "permitted
to prostrate himself on the floor of the
Assembly, and with weeping and howling to
entreat for pardon." His sentence was as follows:
"That in Edinburgh, as the capital, in Dundee,
as his native town, and in Jedburgh, the scene of
his ministrations, he should stand in sackcloth at<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the church door, also on the repentance stool, and
for two Sundays in each place."</p>

<p>A man, on his own confession, was tried for
adultery at the Presbytery of Paisley, on
November 16th, 1626, and directed to "stand and
abyde six Sabbaths barefooted and barelegged at
the kirk-door of Paisley between the second and
third bell-ringing, and thereafter to goe to the
place of public repentance during the said space
of six Sabbaths."</p>

<p>At Stow, in 1627, for a similar crime, a man
was condemned to "sittin' eighteen dyetts" upon
the stool of repentance. Particulars of many
cases similar to the foregoing may be found in the
pages of "Social Life in Scotland," by the Rev.
Charles Rogers, in "Old Church Life in Scotland,"
by the Rev. Andrew Edgar, and in other
works.</p>

<p>Notes bearing on this subject sometimes find
their way into the newspapers, and a couple of
paragraphs from the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i> may be
quoted. On November 18th, 1876, it was stated
that "in a church in the Black Isle, Ross-shire, on
a recent Sunday, a woman who had been guilty
of transgressing the seventh commandment was
condemned to the 'cutty-stool,' and sat during<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the whole service with a black shawl thrown over
her head." A note in the issue for 22nd
February, 1884, says that "one of the ringleaders
in the Sabbatarian riots at Strome Ferry, in
June last, was recently publicly rebuked and
admonished on the 'cutty-stool,' in the Free
Church, Lochcarron, for an offence against the
moral code, which, according to Free Church
discipline in the Highlands, could not be expiated
in any other way."</p>

<h2>The Ducking-Stool.</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scolding</span> women in the olden times were
treated as offenders against the public peace,
and for their transgressions were subjected to
several cruel modes of punishment. The Corporations
of towns during the Middle Ages made their
own regulations for punishing persons guilty of
crimes which were not rendered penal by the laws
of the land. The punishments for correcting scolds
differed greatly in various parts of the country.
It is clear, from a careful study of the history
of medi&aelig;val times, that virtue and amiability
amongst the middle and lower classes, generally
speaking, did not prevail. The free use of the
tongue gave rise to riots and feuds to an extent
which it is difficult for us to realise at the
present day. A strong feeling against scolding
women came down to a late period. Readers of
Boswell's "Life of Johnson" will remember how
the Doctor, in reply to a remark made by a
celebrated Quaker lady, Mrs. Knowles, observed:
"Madam, we have different modes of restraining<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
evil&mdash;stocks for men, a ducking-stool for women,
and a pound for beasts."</p>

<p>The cucking-stool in the early history of
England must not be confounded with the ducking-stool.
They were two distinct machines. It
appears, from a record in the "Domesday Book,"
that as far back as the days of Edward the
Confessor, any man or woman detected giving
false measure in the city of Chester was fined
four shillings; and for brewing bad ale, was
placed in the <i>cathedra stercoris</i>. It was a
degrading mode of chastisement, the culprits
being seated in the chair at their own doors or
in some public place. At Leicester, in 1467, the
local authorities directed "scolds to be punished
by the mayor on a cuck-stool before their own
doors, and then carried to the four gates of the
town." According to Borlase's "Natural History
of Cornwall," in that part of the country
the cucking-stool was used "as a seat of infamy,
where strumpets and scolds, with bare feet and
head, were condemned to abide the derision of
those that passed by, for such time as the bailiffs
of the manors, which had the privilege of such
jurisdiction, did approve." Ale-wives in Scotland
in bygone times who sold bad ale were<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
placed in the cucking-stool. In the year 1555, we
learn from Thomas Wright that "it was enacted
by the queen-regent of Scotland that itinerant
singing women should be put on the cuck-stoles
of every burgh or town; and the first 'Homily
against Contention,' part 3, published in 1562,
sets forth that 'in all well-ordered cities common
brawlers and scolders be punished with a notable
kind of paine, as to be <i>set on</i> the cucking-stole,
pillory, or such-like.' By the statute of 3
Henry VIII., carders and spinners of wool who
were convicted of fraudulent practices were to
be <i>sett upon</i> the pillory or the cukkyng-stole,
man or woman, as the case shall require." We
agree with Mr. Wright when he observes that
the preceding passages are worded in such a
manner as not to lead us to suppose that the
offenders were ducked. In the course of time the
terms cucking and ducking stools became synonymous,
and implied the machines for the
ducking of scolds in water.</p>

<p>In some places the term thewe was used for a
cucking-stool. This was the case at Hedon, and it
occurs in pleadings at Chester before the itinerant
justices and Henry VII., when George Grey, Earl
of Kent, claims the right in his manor of Bushton<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and Ayton of punishing brawlers by the thewe.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Other instances of its use might be cited.</p>

<p>An intelligent Frenchman, named Misson,
visited England about 1700, and has left on
record one of the best descriptions of a ducking-stool
that has been written. It occurs in a work
entitled "Travels in England." "The way of
punishing scolding women," he writes, "is pleasant
enough. They fasten an arm chair to the
end of two beams, twelve or fifteen feet long, and
parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of
wood, with their two ends, embrace the chair,
which hangs between them upon a sort of axle,
by which means it plays freely, and always remains
in the natural horizontal position in which
the chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently
in it, whether you raise it or let it down.
They set up a post on the bank of a pond or
river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio,
the two pieces of wood, at one end of which
the chair hangs just over the water. They place
the woman in this chair, and so plunge her into
the water, as often as the sentence directs, in
order to cool her immoderate heat." In some
instances the ducking was carried to such an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
extent as to cause death. An old chap-book,
without date, is entitled, "Strange and Wonderful
Relation of the Old Woman who was Drowned
at Ratcliff Highway a fortnight ago." It appears
from this work that the poor woman was dipped
too often, for at the conclusion of the operation
she was found to be dead. We reproduce from
this quaint chap-book a picture of the ducking-stool.
It will be observed that it is not a
stationary machine, but one which can be wheeled
to and from the water. Similar ducking-stools
were usually kept in some convenient building,
and ready to be brought out for immediate use,
but in many places the ducking-stools were
permanent fixtures.</p>

DUCKING-STOOL FROM A CHAP-BOOK.</div>

<p>Old municipal accounts and records contain<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
many references to this subject. Cole, a Cambridge
antiquary, collected numerous curious items
connected with this theme. In some extracts made
from the proceedings of the Vice-Chancellor's
Court, in the reign of Elizabeth, it is stated:
"Jane Johnson, adjudged to the ducking-stool
for scolding, and commuted her penance." The
next person does not appear to have been so fortunate
as Jane Johnson, who avoided punishment
by paying a fine of about five shillings. It is
recorded: "Katherine Saunders, accused by the
churchwardens of Saint Andrews for a common
scold and slanderer of her neighbours, was
adjudged to the ducking-stool."</p>

<p>We find in one of Cole's manuscript volumes,
preserved in the British Museum, a graphic
sketch of this ancient mode of punishment. He
says: "In my time, when I was a boy, I lived
with my grandmother in the great corner house
at the foot, 'neath the Magdalen College, Cambridge,
and rebuilt since by my uncle, Joseph
Cook. I remember to have seen a woman
ducked for scolding. The chair was hung by a
pulley fastened to a beam about the middle of the
bridge, in which [he means the chair, of course,
not the bridge] the woman was confined, and let<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
down three times, and then taken out. The
bridge was then of timber, before the present
stone bridge of one arch was built. The ducking-stool
was constantly hanging in its place, and on
the back of it were engraved devils laying hold of
scolds, etc. Some time afterwards a new chair
was erected in the place of the old one, having
the same devices carved upon it, and well painted
and ornamented. When the new bridge of stone
was erected, in 1754, this chair was taken away,
and I lately saw the carved and gilt back of it
nailed up by the shop of one Mr. Jackson, a
whitesmith, in the Butcher's Row, behind the
Town Hall, who offered it to me, but I did not
know what to do with it. In October, 1776, I
saw in the old Town Hall a third ducking-stool,
of plain oak, with an iron bar in front of it, to
confine the person in the seat, but I made no
inquiries about it. I mention these things as the
practice of ducking scolds in the river seems now
to be totally laid aside." Mr. Cole died in 1782,
so did not long survive the writing of the foregoing
curious notes.</p>

<p>The Sandwich ducking-stool was embellished
with men and women scolding. On the cross-bar
were carved the following words:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of members ye tonge is worst or best,&mdash;an<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yll tonge oft doeth breede unrest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Boys, in his "Collections for the History of
Sandwich," published in 1792, remarks that the
ducking-stool was preserved in the second storey
of the Town Hall, along with the arms, offensive
and defensive, of the Trained Bands. Boys's
book includes some important
information on
old-time punishments.
In the year 1534, it
is recorded that two
women were banished
from Sandwich for
immorality. To deter
them from coming back
to the town, it was decided
that "if they
return, one of them is
to suffer the pain of sitting over the coqueen-stool,
and the other is to be set three days in the stocks,
with an allowance of only bread and water, and
afterwards to be placed in the coqueen-stool and
dipped to the chin." A woman, in the year 1568,
was "carted and banished." At Sandwich,
Ipswich, and some other places, as a punishment<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
for scolding and other offences it was not an
uncommon thing to compel the transgressors to
carry a wooden mortar round the town.</p>

SANDWICH DUCKING-STOOL.</div>

<p>Respecting the cost of erecting a ducking-stool,
we find a curious and detailed account in the
parish books of Southam, Warwickshire, for the
year 1718. In the first place, a man was
sent from Southam to Daventry to make a drawing
of the ducking-stool of that town, at a cost of
three shillings and twopence. The sum of one
pound one shilling and eightpence is charged for
labour and material in making and fixing the
engine of punishment. An entry of ten shillings
is made for painting it, which appears a rather
heavy amount when we observe that the carpenter
only charged a little over a pound for labour and
timber. Perhaps, like the good folk of Sandwich,
the authorities of Southam had their chair
ornamented with artistic portraits and enriched
with poetic quotations. The blacksmith had to
furnish ironwork, etc., at a cost of four shillings
and sixpence. For carrying the stool to its
proper place half-a-crown was paid. Lastly, nine
shillings and sixpence had to be expended to make
the pond deeper, so that the ducking-stool might
work in a satisfactory manner. The total amount<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
reached &pound;2 11s. 4d. At Coventry, in the same
county, we find traces of two ducking-stools, and
respecting them Mr. W. G. Fretton, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>,
supplies us with some curious details. The following
notes are drawn from the Leet Book, under
date of October 11th, 1597: "Whereas there
are divers and sundrie disordered persons (women)
within this citie that be scolds, brawlers, disturbers,
and disquieters of theire neighbors, to the great
offence of Almightie God and the breach of Her
Majestie's peace: for the reformation of such
abuses, it is ordered and enacted at this leet, that
if any disordered and disquiet persons of this citie
do from henceforth scold or brawle with their
neighbo'rs or others, upon complaint thereof to the
Alderman of the ward made, or to the Maior for
the time being, they shall be committed to the
cooke-stoole lately appointed for the punishment
of such offenders, and thereupon be punished
for their deserts, except they or everie of them, do
presentlie paie iijs iijd for their redemption from
that punishment to the use of the poore of this
citie." The old accounts of the City of Coventry
contain numerous items bearing on the ducking-stool.</p>

<p>In a volume of "Miscellaneous Poems," by<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Benjamin West, of Weedon Beck, Northamptonshire,
published in 1780, we find some lines
entitled, "The Ducking-Stool," which run:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="noin">A footnote to the poem states: "To the honour
of the fair sex in the neighbourhood of R&mdash;&mdash;y,
this machine has been taken down (as useless)
several years." Most probably, says Mr. Jewitt,
the foregoing refers to Rugby. In the old
accounts of that town several items occur, as for
example:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p class="noin">Mr. Petty, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, in a note to Mr. Jewitt, which
is inserted in <i>The Reliquary</i> for January, 1861,
states that the Rugby ducking-stool "was placed
on the west side of the horsepool, near the footpath
leading from the Clifton Road towards the
new churchyard. Part of the posts to which it
was affixed were visible until very lately, and the
National School is now erected on its site. The
last person who underwent the punishment was a
man for beating his wife about forty years since;
but although the ducking-stool has been long
removed, the ceremony of immersion in the horse-pond<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
was recently inflicted on an inhabitant for
brutality towards his wife." The Rugby ducking-stool
was of the trebuchet form, somewhat similar
to one which was in use at Broadwater, near
Worthing, and which has been frequently
engraved. We reproduce an illustration of the
latter from the <i>Wiltshire Arch&aelig;ological Magazine</i>,
which represents it as it appeared in the year
1776. It was in existence at a much later period.
Its construction was very simple, consisting of a
short post let into the ground at the edge of a
pond, bearing on the top a transverse beam, one
end of which carried the stool, while the other
end was secured by a rude chair. We are told,
in an old description of this ducking-stool, that
the beam could be moved horizontally, so as to
bring the seat to the edge of the pond, and that
when the beam was moved back, so as to place<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the seat and the person in it over the pond, the
beam was worked up and down like a see-saw,
and so the person in the seat was ducked. When
the machine was not in use, the end of the beam
which came on land was secured to a stump in
the ground by a padlock, to prevent the village
children from ducking each other.</p>

DUCKING-STOOL, BROADWATER, NEAR WORTHING.</div>

<p>Mr. T. Tindall Wildridge, author of several
important local historical works, says that the
great profligacy of Hull frequently gave rise in
olden times to very stringent exercise of the
magisterial authority. Not infrequently this was
at the direct instigation and sometimes command
of the Archbishop of York. Occasionally the
cognisance of offences was retrospective. Thus,
in November, 1620, it was resolved by the Bench
of Magistrates, then composed of the Aldermen
of the town, that such as had been "faltie for
bastardes" should be carted about the town and
afterwards "ducked in the water for their faults,
for which they have hitherto escaped punishment."
At a little later period, in England, in
the days of the Commonwealth, it was enacted
on May 14th, 1650, that adultery should be punished
with death, but there is not any record of
the law taking effect. The Act was repealed at<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the Restoration. About a century before this
period, namely, in 1563, in the Scottish Parliament,
this crime was made a capital offence. In
New England, in the year 1662, several men and
women suffered for this crime.</p>

<p>Resuming our notes on the Hull ducking-stool,
we find, according to Hadley, the historian, that
in the year 1731 Mr. Beilby, who held the office
of town's husband, was ordered to take care that
a ducking-stool should be provided at the South-end
for the benefit of scolds and unquiet women.
Six years later, John Hilbert published a view of
the town of Hull, in which there is a representation
of the ducking-stool. Mr. Wildridge has found
traces of another local ducking-stool. He states
that in some accounts belonging to the eighteenth
century there is a charge for tarring a ducking-stool
situated on the Haven-side, on the east side
of the town.</p>

<p>At the neighbouring town of Beverley are
traces of this old mode of punishment, and in the
town records are several notes bearing on the
subject. Brewers of bad beer and bakers of bad
bread, as well as scolding women, were placed in
the ducking-stool.</p>

<p>The Leeds ducking-stool was at Quarry Hill,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
near the Spa. At the Court of Quarter Sessions,
held in the town in July, 1694, it was "ordered
that Anne, the wife of Phillip Saul, a person
of lewd behaviour, be ducked for daily making
strife and discord amongst her neighbours." A
similar order was made against Jane Milner and
Elizabeth Wooler.</p>

<p>We find in the Session records of Wakefield,
for 1602, the following:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"Punishm<sup>t</sup> of Hall and Robinson, scolds: fforasmuch as
Katherine Hall and M'garet Robinson, of Wakefield, are
great disturbers and disquieters of their neighbours w'thin
the toune of Wakefield, by reason of their daily scolding
and chydering, the one w'th the other, for reformacon
whereof ytt it is ordered that if they doe hereafter continue
their former course of life in scolding and brawling, that
then John Mawde, the high constable there, shall cause
them to be soundlye ducked or cucked on the cuckstool
at Wakefield for said misdemeanour."</p></div>

<p>In the records of Wakefield Sessions, under
date of October 5th, 1671, the following appears:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>"Forasmuch as Jane, the wife of William Farrett of
Selby, shoemaker, stands indicted at this sessions for a
common scold, to the great annoyance and disturbance of
her neighbours, and breach of His Majesty's peace. It is
therefore ordered that the said Jane Farrett, for the said
offence be openly ducked, and ducked three times over the
head and ears by the constables of Selby aforesaid, for
which this shall be their warrant."</p></div><p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>At Bradford, the ducking-stool was formerly at
the Beck, near to the Parish Church, and on the
formation of the canal it was removed, but only a
short distance from its original position. Still
lingering in the West Riding of Yorkshire, we
find in the parish accounts of East Ardsley, a
village near to Wakefield, the following item:</p>

<p class="noin">Norrisson Scatcherd, in his "History of Morley,"
and William Smith, in his "Morley Ancient and
Modern," give interesting details of the ducking-stool
at Morley.</p>

<p>Not far distant from Morley is Calverley, and
in the Constable's accounts of the village it is
stated:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>Mr. Joseph Wilkinson, the historian of Worsborough,
near Barnsley, mentions two ducking-ponds
in the township&mdash;one in the village of
Worsborough, another near to the Birdwell toll-bar;
and, judging from the frequency with which
ducking-stools were repaired by the township,
it would seem they were often brought into
requisition. The following extracts are drawn
from the parish accounts:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Dawson, the historian of Skipton,
has devoted considerable attention to the old-time
punishments of the town, and the first reference
he was able to discover amongst the old accounts
of the township is the following:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="pr1">1734.</td><td class="tda">October 2nd. To Wm. Bell, for ducking-stool making
and wood</td><td class="td2">8s.</td><td class="td3">6d.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noin">"This must," says Mr. Dawson, "surely mean
that the chair was changed, for the amount is
too small for the entire apparatus. In this case
a ducking-stool must have existed before 1734,
which is very likely." In the same Skipton
township account-book is an entry as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="pr1">1743.</td><td class="tda">October. Ben Smith for ducking-stool</td><td class="td2">4s.</td><td class="td3">6d.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noin">Twenty-five years later we find a payment as
follows:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">

ducking-stool</td><td class="td2">&pound;1</td><td class="td3">0s.</td><td class="td3">11&frac12;d.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noin">Mr. Dawson has not been able to discover the
exact date when the ducking-stool fell into disuse,
but has good reason for believing that it was
about 1770. We gather from a note sent to us
by Mr. Dawson that: "A ducking-pond existed
at Kirkby, although it had not been used within
the memory of any living person. Scolds of both
sexes were punished by being ducked; indeed, in
the last observance of the custom, a tailor and his
wife were ducked together, in view of a large
gathering of people. The husband had applied
for his wife to undergo the punishment on
account of her quarrelsome nature, but the magistrate
decided that one was not better than the
other, and he ordered a joint punishment! Back
to back, therefore, husband and wife were chaired
and dipped into the cold water of the pond!
Whether it was in remembrance of this old observance
or not cannot be definitely said, but it
is nevertheless a fact that in East Lancashire, in
1880, a man who had committed some violation
of morals was forcibly taken by a mob, and
dragged several times through a pond until he
had expressed penitence for his act."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>We have found several allusions to the Derby
ducking-stool. Wooley, writing in 1772, states
that "over against the steeple [All Saint's] is
St. Mary's Gate, which leads down to the brook
near the west side of St. Werburgh's Church,
over which there is a bridge to Mr. Osborne's
mill, over the pool of which stands the ducking-stool.
A joiner named Thomas Timmins repaired
it in 1729, and charged as follows:</p>

SCARBOROUGH DUCKING-STOOL.</div>

<p>The Chesterfield ducking-stool was pulled down
towards the close of the last century. It is stated
that in the latter part of its existence it was chiefly
used for punishing refractory paupers.</p>

<p>The Scarborough ducking-stool was formerly
placed on the old pier, and was last used about
the year 1795, when a Mrs. Gamble was ducked.
The chair is preserved in the Museum of the
Scarborough Philosophical Society. We are indebted
to Dr. T. N. Brushfield for an excellent
drawing of it.</p>

<p>An object which attracts much attention from
visitors to the interesting museum at Ipswich is
the ducking-stool of the town. We give a carefully<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
executed drawing of it. It is described as a
strong-backed arm-chair, with a wrought-iron rod,
about an inch in diameter, fastened to each arm
in front, meeting in a segment of a circle above;
there is also another iron rod affixed to the back,
which curves over the
head of the person
seated in the chair,
and is connected with
the other at the top,
to the centre of which
is fastened an iron ring
for the purpose of
slinging the machine
into the river. It is
plain and substantial,
and has more the appearance
of solidity
than antiquity in its
construction. We are
told by the local historian
that in the Chamberlain's books are various
entries for money paid to porters for taking down
the ducking-stool and assisting in the operation of
cooling, by its means, the inflammable passions of
some of the female inhabitants of Ipswich.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

IPSWICH DUCKING-STOOL.</div>

<p>We give a spirited sketch of the Ipswich
ducking-stool, from the pencil of Campion, a local
artist. It is worthy of the pencil of Hogarth,
Gilray, or Cruikshank; indeed, it is often said to
be the production of the last-named artist, but
though after his style it is not his work.</p>

<p>There are traces in the Court-Book of St.
George's Gild of the use
of the ducking-stool at
Norwich. Amongst other
entries is one to the effect
that in 1597 a scold was
ducked three times.</p>

<p>The ducking-stool at
Nottingham, in addition
to being employed for
correcting scolds, was
used for the exposure of
females of bad repute.
"It consisted," says Mr. J. Potter Briscoe, <span class="smcapl">F.R.H.S.</span>,
"of a hollow box, which was sufficiently large to
admit of two persons being exposed at the same
time. Through holes in the side the heads of the
culprits were placed. In fact, the Nottingham
cuck-stool was similar to a pillory. The last time
this ancient instrument of punishment was brought<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
into requisition was in 1731, when the Mayor
(Thomas Trigge) caused a female to be placed
in it for immorality, and left her to the mercy
of the mob, who ducked her so severely that her
death ensued shortly afterwards. The Mayor, in
consequence, was prosecuted, and the Nottingham
cuck-stool was ordered to be destroyed." In the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Nottinghamshire records are traces of the ducking-stool
at Southwell and Retford. The example
of the latter town is traced back to an unusually
early period.</p>

IPSWICH DUCKING-STOOL.</div>

<p>The old ducking-stool of King's Lynn, Norfolk,
may now be seen in the Museum of that town.
The annals of the borough contain
numerous allusions to the
punishment of women. In the
year 1587, it is stated that for
immoral conduct, John Wanker's
wife and widow Parker
were both carted. It is recorded
that, in 1754, "one Elizabeth
Neivel stood in the pillory, and
that one Hannah Clark was
ducked for scolding." There
is mention of a woman named
Howard standing in the pillory in 1782, but no
particulars are given of her crime.</p>

DUCKING-STOOL, KING'S LYNN.</div>

<p>In a note written for us in 1881, by Mr. R. N.
Worth, the historian of Plymouth, we are told
that in Devon and Cornwall the ducking-stool
was the usual means employed for inflicting punishment
on scolding women. At Plymouth, the
ducking-stool was erected at the Barbican, a site<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
full of historic interest. From here Sir Walter
Raleigh was conducted to his long imprisonment,
followed by death on the scaffold. It was here
that the Pilgrim Fathers bade adieu to the shores
of their native land to establish a New England
across the Atlantic. As might be expected, the
old municipal accounts of
Plymouth contain many
curious and interesting
items bearing on the punishment
of women. Mr.
W. H. K. Wright, editor
of the <i>Western Antiquary</i>,
tells us that as recently as
the year 1808 the last
person was ducked. At
Plymouth, at the present
time, are preserved two
ducking-chairs, one in the
Athen&aelig;um and the other
in the office of the Borough
Surveyor. Mr. Wright has
kindly supplied illustrations of both. It will be
observed that the chairs are made of iron.</p>

<p>The last time the Bristol ducking-stool was

Mayor gave instructions for the ducking of scolds,
and the immersions took place at the weir.</p>

PLYMOUTH DUCKING-STOOL.</div>

<p>We have numerous accounts of this engine of
punishment in Lancashire. In the "Manchester
Historical Recorder" we find it stated, in the
year 1775: "Manchester ducking-stool in use.
It was an open-bottomed chair of wood, placed
upon a long pole balanced on a pivot, and suspended
over the collection
of water called the Pool
House and Pool Fold. It
was afterwards suspended
over the Daubholes (Infirmary
pond) and was used
for the purpose of punishing
scolds and prostitutes." We
find, on examination of an
old print, that it was similar
to the example at Broadwater,
of which we give a sketch. According to
Mr. Richard Brooke's "Liverpool from 1775 to
1800," the ducking-stool was in use in 1779, by
the authority of the magistrates. We have details
of the ducking-stool at Preston, Kirkham, Burnley
and other Lancashire towns.</p>

<p>At Wootton Bassett there was a tumbrel,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
which, until within the last few years, was perfect.
The chair is still preserved by the corporation
of that town. We give a drawing of it from
the <i>Wiltshire Arch&aelig;ological and Natural History
Magazine</i>. It will be seen from the picture that
the machine, when complete, consisted of a chair, a
pair of wheels, two long poles forming shafts, and
a rope attached to each shaft, at about a foot from
the end. The person to be ducked was tied in
the chair, and the machine pushed into a pond
called the Weirpond, and the shafts being let go,
the scold was lifted backwards into the water, the
shafts flying up, and being recovered again by
means of the ropes attached to them. The chair
is of oak, and bears the date of 1686 on the back.
In some places, millers, if detected stealing corn,
were placed in the tumbrel.</p>

TUMBREL AT WOOTTON BASSETT.</div>

<p>The wheels of a tumbrel are preserved in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the old church of St. Mary's, Warwick, and the
chair, it is said, is still in the possession of an
inhabitant of the town.</p>

<p>At Kingston-upon-Thames ducking was not
infrequent. The Chamberlain's accounts include
many items relating to the subject. We are
disposed to believe, from the mention of three
wheels, in a payment made in 1572, that here the
engine of punishment was a tumbrel. The following
amounts were paid in 1572:</p>

<p>In the <i>London Evening Post</i>, April 27th to
30th, 1745, it is stated: "Last week a woman who
keeps the Queen's Head alehouse, at Kingston, in
Surrey, was ordered by the court to be ducked
for scolding, and was accordingly placed in the
chair and ducked in the river Thames, under
Kingston Bridge, in the presence of 2000 to 3000
people."</p>

<p>We have previously mentioned the fact that at
Leicester the cucking-stool was in use as early as
1467, and from some valuable information brought<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
together by Mr. William Kelly, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, and included
in his important local works, we learn that
the last entry he has traced in the old accounts
of the town is the following:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Mr. Kelly refers to the scolding cart at Leicester,
and describes the culprit as seated upon it,
and being drawn through the town. He found
in the old accounts in 1629 an item:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noin">Scolding Cart is another name for the tumbrel.</p>

<p>The latest example of Leicester cucking-stool
is preserved in the local museum, and was placed
there at the suggestion of Mr. Kelly.</p>

LEOMINSTER DUCKING-STOOL.</div>

<p>The Leominster ducking-stool is one of the
few examples still preserved. It was formerly
kept in the parish church. We have an excellent
drawing of it in that building from the pencil of
the genial author of "Verdant Green," Cuthbert
Bede. The Rev. Geo. Fyler Townsend, <span class="smcapl">M.A.</span>,
the erudite historian of Leominster, furnishes us
with some important information on this interesting
relic of the olden time. He says that it is a
machine of the simplest construction, "It consists<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
merely of a strong narrow under framework,
placed on four wheels, of solid wood, about four
inches in thickness, and eighteen in diameter. At
one end of this framework two upright posts,
about three feet in height, strongly embedded in
the platform, carry a long movable beam. Each
of the arms of this beam are of equal length (13
feet), and balance perfectly from the top of the
post. The culprit placed in the seat naturally
weighs down that one end into the water, while
the other is lifted up in the air; men, however,
with ropes, caused the uplifted end to rise or fall,
and thus obtain a perfect see-saw. The purchase
of the machine is such that the culprit can be<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
launched forth some 16 to 18 feet into the pond or
stream, while the administrators of the ducking
stand on dry land. This instrument was mentioned
in the ancient documents of the borough
by various names, as the cucking-stoole or timbrill,
or gumstole."</p>

<p>The latest recorded instance of the ducking-stool
being used in England occurred at Leominster.
In 1809, says Mr. Townsend, a woman,
Jenny Pipes, alias Jane Corran, was paraded
through the town on the ducking-stool, and actually
ducked in the water near Kenwater Bridge,
by order of the magistrates. An eye witness
gave his testimony to the desert of the punishment
inflicted on this occasion, in the fact that the first
words of the culprit on being unfastened from the
chair were oaths and curses on the magistrates.
In 1817, a woman named Sarah Leeke was
wheeled round the town in the chair, but not
ducked, as the water was too low. Since this
time, the use of the chair has been laid aside, and
it is an object of curiosity, rather than of fear, to
any of the spectators. During the recent restoration
of Leominster Church, the ducking-stool was
removed, repaired, and renovated by Mr. John
Hungerford Arkwright, and is now kept at the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
borough gaol of the historically interesting town
of Leominster.</p>

<p>The early English settlers in the United States
introduced many of the manners and customs of
their native land. The ducking-stool was soon
brought into use. Mr. Henry M. Brooks, in his
carefully written work, called "Strange and Curious
Punishments," published in 1886, by Ticknor
&amp; Co., of Boston, gives many important details respecting
punishing scolds. At the present time,
in some parts of America, scolding females are
liable to be punished by means of the ducking-stool.
We gather from a newspaper report that
in 1889, the grand jury of Jersey City&mdash;across
the Hudson River from New York&mdash;caused a
sensation by indicting Mrs. Mary Brady as a
"common scold." Astonished lawyers hunted up
their old books, and discovered that scolding is
still an indictable offence in New Jersey, and that
the ducking-stool is still available as a punishment
for it, not having been specifically abolished
when the revised statutes were adopted. In
Delaware, the State next to the south of New
Jersey, the whipping-post is an institution, and
prisoners are sentenced to suffer at it every week.
The Common Scold Law was brought from<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
England to Connecticut by the Puritans and
settlers, and from Connecticut they carried it with
them into New Jersey, which is incorrectly considered
a Dutch state. In closing this chapter, we
may state that a Dalziel telegram from Ottawa,
published in the London newspapers of August
8th, 1890, says that Miss Annie Pope was yesterday
charged before a police magistrate, under the
provisions of an antiquated statute, for being a
"common scold." She was committed for trial at
the assizes, as the magistrate had no ducking-stool.</p>

<h2>The Brank, or Scold's Bridle.</h2>

<div class="figr" style="width: 172px;"><img class="mb0" src="images/063.png" width="172" height="231" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> brank was an instrument employed by
our forefathers for punishing scolds. It is
also sometimes called the gossip's bridle, and in
the Macclesfield town records it is designated
"a brydle for a curste queane." In the term
"queane" we have the
old English synonym
for a woman; now
the chief woman, the
Queen. The brank
is not of such great
antiquity as the ducking-stool,
for the
earliest mention of it
we have been able to
find in this country
is in the Corporation
records of Macclesfield,
of the year 1623. At an earlier period, we
have traces of it in Scotland. In Glasgow burgh
records, it is stated that in 1574 two scolds were
condemned to be "branket." The Kirk-session<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
records of Stirling for 1600 mention the "brankes"
as a punishment for the shrew. It is generally
believed that the punishment is of Continental
origin.</p>

<p>The brank may be described simply as an iron
framework which was placed on the head, enclosing
it in a kind of cage; it had in front a plate
of iron, which, either sharpened or covered with
spikes, was so situated as to be placed in the mouth
of the victim, and if she attempted to move her
tongue in any way whatever, it was certain to be
shockingly injured. With a brank on her head
she was conducted through the streets, led by a
chain, held by one of the town's officials, an object
of contempt, and subjected to the jeers of the
crowd and often left to their mercy. In some
towns it was the custom to chain the culprit to the
pillory, whipping-post, or market-cross. She thus
suffered for telling her mind to some petty tyrant
in office, or speaking plainly to a wrong-doer, or
for taking to task a lazy, and perhaps a drunken
husband.</p>

BRANK IN LEEDS PHILOSOPHICAL
MUSEUM.</div>

<p>In Yorkshire, we have only seen two branks.
We give a sketch of one formerly in possession of
the late Norrisson Scatcherd, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span>, the historian
of Morley. It is now in the Leeds Philosophical<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Museum, where it attracts considerable attention.
It is one of the most simple and harmless
examples that has come under our notice.
Amongst the relics of the olden time in the
Museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society,
York, is another specimen, equally simple in its
construction. It was presented by Lady Thornton
to the Society in
1880, and near it may
be seen thumb-screws
from York Castle; leg
bar, waist girdle, and
wrist shackles, worn by
the notorious highwayman,
Dick Turpin, executed
April 17th, 1739;
and a leg bar, worn by
another notorious highwayman,
named Nevison, who suffered death on
the gallows, May 4th, 1684.</p>

<p>The brank which has received the greatest
attention is the one preserved in the vestry of
Walton-on-Thames Parish Church. It bears the
date of 1632, and the following couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Chester presents Walton with a bridle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To curb women's tongues that talk too idle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>It is traditionally said that this brank was given
to Walton Parish by a person named Chester,
who had, through a gossiping and lying woman
of his acquaintance, lost an estate he expected to
inherit from a rich relative. We are enabled to
give an illustration of the Walton brank.</p>

BRANK AT WALTON-ON-THAMES.</div>

<p>Dr. T. N. Brushfield described in an exhaustive
manner all the Cheshire branks, in an able
paper read before the Architectural, Arch&aelig;ological,
and Historic Society of Chester, and published
in 1858. We are unable to direct attention
to all the branks noticed by Dr. Brushfield, but
cannot refrain from presenting the following account
of the one at Congleton, which is preserved
in the Town Hall of that ancient borough. "It
was," we are informed, "formerly in the hands
of the town jailor, whose services were not infrequently
called into requisition. In the old-fashioned,
half-timbered houses in the borough,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
there was generally fixed on one side of the large
open fire-places a hook, so that, when a man's
wife indulged her scolding propensities, the husband
sent for the town jailor to bring the bridle,
and had her bridled and chained to the hook until
she promised to behave herself better for the
future. I have seen one of these hooks, and have
often heard husbands say to their wives: 'If you
don't rest with your tongue I'll send for the bridle
and hook you up.' The Mayor and Justices
frequently brought the instrument into use; for
when women were brought before them charged
with street-brawling, and insulting the constables
and others while in the discharge of their duty,
they have ordered them to be bridled and led
through the borough by the jailor. The last time
this bridle was publicly used was in 1824, when a
woman was brought before the Mayor (Bulkeley
Johnson, Esq.) one Monday, charged with scolding
and using harsh language to the churchwardens
and constables as they went, on the
Sunday morning, round the town to see that all
the public-houses were empty and closed during
divine service. On examination, a Mr. Richard
Edwards stated on oath that on going round the
town with the churchwardens on the previous<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
day, they met the woman (Ann Runcorn) in a
place near 'The Cockshoot,' and that immediately
seeing them she commenced a sally of
abuse, calling them all the scoundrels and rogues
she could lay her tongue to; and telling them 'it
would look better of them if they would look
after their own houses rather than go looking
after other folk's, which were far better than their
own.' After other abuse of a like character, they
thought it only right to apprehend her, and so
brought her before the Bench on the following
day. The Mayor then delivered the following
sentence: 'That it is the unanimous decision of
the Mayor and Justices that the prisoner (Ann
Runcorn) there and then have the town's bridle
for scolding women put upon her, and that she be
led by the magistrate's clerk's clerk through every
street in the town, as an example to all scolding
women; and that the Mayor and magistrates were
much obliged to the churchwardens for bringing
the case before them.'" "In this case," Mr. Warrington,
who furnished Dr. Brushfield with the
foregoing information, adds: "I both heard the
evidence and saw the decision carried out. The
bridle was put on the woman, and she was then
led through the town by one Prosper Haslam, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
town clerk's clerk, accompanied by hundreds of
the inhabitants; and on her return to the Town
Hall the bridle was taken off in the presence of
the Mayor, magistrates, constables, churchwardens,
and assembled inhabitants."</p>

BRANK AT STOCKPORT.</div>

<p>In Cheshire, at the present time, there are
traces of thirteen branks, and at Stockport is the
most brutal example of
the English branks.
"It will be observed,"
says the local historian,
Dr. Henry Heginbotham,
<span class="smcapl">J.P.</span>, "that the
special characteristic of
this brank is the peculiar
construction of the
tongue-plate or gag.
It is about two inches
long, having at the end,
as may be seen in the engraving, a ball, into
which is inserted a number of sharp iron pins,
three on the upper surface, three on the lower, and
two pointing backwards. These could not fail to
pin the tongue, and effectually silence the noisiest
brawler. At the fore part of the collar, there is
an iron chain, with a leathern thong attached,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
by which the offender was led for public gaze
through the market-place." It was formerly on
market days exhibited in front of the house of
the person who had charge of it, as a warning to
scolding or swearing women. Dr. Heginbotham
states that: "There is no evidence of its having
been actually used for many years, but there is
testimony to the fact, that within the last forty
years the brank was brought to a termagant
market woman, who was effectually silenced by
its threatened application."</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Alfred Burton for a
drawing of the Macclesfield brank. Dr. Brushfield
describes this as "a respectable-looking brank."
He tells us that "the gag is plain, and the end of
it is turned down; there is only one band which
passes over the head, and is hinged to the hoops;
a temporary joint exists at the upper part, and
ample provision is made for readily adjusting it to
any description of head. The chain still remains
attached to the hoop. About the year 1858,
Mr. Swinnerton informed Dr. Brushfield that he
had never seen it used, but that at the petty
sessions it had often been produced <i>in terrorem</i>,
to stay the volubility of a woman's tongue; and
that a threat by a magistrate to order its appliance<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
had always proved sufficient to abate the garrulity
of the most determined scold."</p>

BRANK AT MACCLESFIELD.</div>

<p>Towards the close of the first quarter of the
present century, the brank was last used at
Altrincham. A virago, who caused her neighbours
great trouble, was frequently cautioned in
vain respecting her conduct, and as a last resource
she was condemned to walk through the
town wearing the brank. She refused to move,
and it was finally decided to wheel her in a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
barrow through the principal streets of the town,
round the market-place, and to her own home.
The punishment had the desired effect, and for
the remainder of her life she kept a quiet tongue.</p>

<p>There are many traces of the brank in Lancashire.
Mr. W. E. A. Axon informs us that his
father remembers the brank being used at Manchester
at the commencement of the present
century. Kirkham had its brank for scolds, in
addition to a ducking-stool. We find, in the same
county, traces of the brank at Holme, in the Forest
of Rossendale. In the accounts of the Greave for
the Forest of Rossendale for 1691-2 is an entry of
the true antiquarian cast:</p>

</table></div>

<p>In "Some Obsolete Peculiarities of English
Law," by William Beamont, the author gives
particulars respecting the Warrington brank.
"Hanging up in our museum," says Mr.
Beamont, "may be seen a representation of a
withered female face wearing the brank or scold's
bridle; one of which instruments, as inflexible as
iron and ingenuity can make it, for keeping an
unruly tongue quiet by mechanical means, hangs
up beside it; and almost within the time of living
memory, Cicily Pewsill, an inmate of the workhouse,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and a notorious scold, was seen wearing
this disagreeable head-gear in the streets of
Warrington for half-an-hour or more.... Cicily
Pewsill's case still lingers in tradition, as the last
occasion of its application in Warrington, and it
will soon pass into history."</p>

BRANK AT THE MANOR HOUSE, HAMSTALL RIDWARE.</div>

<p>The Rev. J. Clay told Mr. William Dobson
that since his connection with Preston House of
Correction the brank was put on a woman there,
but the matter coming to the knowledge of the
Home Secretary, its further use was prohibited,
and to make sure of the barbarous practice being
discontinued the brank itself was ordered to be
sent to London. A second brank was kept in the
prison, principally formed of leather, but with an
iron tongue-piece.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>At the north country town of Morpeth a brank
is still preserved. The following is a record of its
use: "Dec. 3, 1741, Elizabeth, wife of George
Holborn, was punished with the branks for two
hours, at the Market Cross, Morpeth, by order of
Mr. Thomas Gait and Mr. George Nicholls, then
bailiffs, for scandalous and opprobrious language to
several persons in the town, as well as to the said
bailiffs."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

BRANK AT LICHFIELD.</div>

<p>Staffordshire supplies several notable examples
of the brank. They were formerly kept at
Hamstall Ridware, Beaudesart, Lichfield, Walsall,
and at Newcastle-under-Lyme. The branks in
the two towns last named are alluded to by the
celebrated Dr. Plot, the old historian of the
county, in an amusing manner. "We come to
the arts that respect mankind," says Plot,
"amongst which, as elsewhere, the civility of
precedence must be allowed to the woman, and
that as well in punishments as favours. For the
former, whereof they have such a peculiar artifice
at Newcastle [under Lyme] and Walsall for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
correcting of scolds, which it does, too, so
effectually and so very safely, that I look upon it
as much to be preferred to the cucking-stool,
which not only endangers the health of the party,
but also gives her tongue liberty 'twixt every dip,
to neither of which is this at all liable, it being
such a bridle for the tongue as not only quite
deprives them of speech, but brings shame for the
transgression, and
humility thereupon,
before 'tis taken off.
Which, being an
instrument scarce
heard of, much less
seen, I have here
presented it to the
reader's view [here
follows a reference
to a plate] as it was taken from the original one,
made of iron, at Newcastle-under-Lyme, wherein
the letter <i>a</i> shows the jointed collar that comes
round the neck; <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, the loops and staples to let
it out and in, according to the bigness and
slenderness of the neck; <i>d</i>, the jointed semicircle
that comes over the head, made forked at one end
to let through the nose, and <i>e</i>, the plate-iron that<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
is put into the mouth and keeps down the
tongue. Which, being put upon the offender by
order of the magistrate, and fastened with a padlock
behind, she is led through the town by an
officer, to her shame, nor is it taken off until after
the party begins to show all external signs
imaginable of humiliation and amendment." This
brank afterwards passed into the hands of Mr.
Joseph Mayer, <span class="smcapl">F.S.A.</span> founder of the Museum
at Liverpool.</p>

CHESTERFIELD BRANK.</div>

<p>It is pleasing to record the fact that there is
only trace of one brank belonging to Derbyshire&mdash;a
circumstance which speaks well for its men
and women. The latter have for a long period
borne exemplary characters. Philip Kinder, in
the preface of his projected "History of Derbyshire,"
written about the middle of the seventeenth
century, alludes to them. "The country-women
here," says Kinder, "are chaste and sober, and
very diligent in their housewifery; they hate
idleness, love and obey their husbands; only in
some of the great towns many of the seeming
sanctificators used to follow the Presbyterian gang,
and on a lecture day put on their best rayment,
and doo hereby take occasion to goo a gossipping.
Your merry wives of Bentley will sometimes look<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
in ye glass, chirpe a cupp merrily, yet not
indecently. In the Peak they are much given to
dance after the bagpipes&mdash;almost every towne hath
a bagpipe in it." "The Chesterfield brank," says
Mr. Llewellyn Jewitt, "is a remarkably good
example, and has the additional interest of bearing
a date. It is nine inches in height, and six inches
and three-quarters
across the hoop. It
consists of a hoop
of iron, hinged on
either side and fastening
behind, and a
band, also of iron,
passing over the
head from back to
front, and opening
in front to admit the
nose of the woman
whose misfortune it
was to wear it. The
mode of putting it on
would be thus: the brank would be opened by
throwing back the sides of the hoop, and the hinder
part of the band by means of the hinges, <span class="smcapl">C</span>, <span class="smcapl">F</span>, <span class="smcapl">F</span>.
The constable, or other official, would then stand in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
front of his victim, and force the knife, or plate, <span class="smcapl">A</span>,
into her mouth, the divided band passing on either
side of the nose, which would protrude through the
opening, <span class="smcapl">B</span>. The hoop would then be closed
behind, the band brought down from the top to
the back of the head, and fastened down upon it,
at <span class="smcapl">E</span>, and thus the cage would at once be firmly
and immovably fixed so long as her tormentors
might think fit. On the left side is a chain, <span class="smcapl">D</span>,
one end of which is attached to the hoop, and at
the other end is a ring, by which the victim was
led, or by which she was, at pleasure, attached to
a post or wall. On front of the brank are the
initials '<span class="smcapl">T.C.</span>,' and the date '1688'&mdash;the year of
the 'Glorious Revolution'&mdash;the year of all years
memorable in the annals of Chesterfield and the
little village of Whittington, closely adjoining, in
which the Revolution was planned. Strange
that an instrument of brutal and tyrannical
torture should be made and used at Chesterfield
at the same moment that the people should be
plotting for freedom at the same place. The
brank was formerly in the old poor-house at
Chesterfield, and came into the hands of Mr.
Weale, the assistant Poor-law Commissioner, who
presented it to Lady Walsham. It is (August,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
1860) still in the hands of Sir John Walsham,
Bart., and the drawing from which the accompanying
woodcut is executed was kindly made
and furnished to me by Miss Dulcy Bell, Sir
John's sister-in-law."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

BRANK FORMERLY IN THE POSSESSION OF MR. CARRINGTON.</div>

<p>In the year 1821, Judge
Richardson gave orders
for a brank to be destroyed
which was kept ready and
most probably frequently
used at the County Hall,
Nottingham. We gather
from a note furnished by
Mr. J. Potter Briscoe a
curious circumstance in connection with this brank&mdash;that
it was used to subdue the unruly tongues of
the sterner sex, as well as those of noisy females.
James Brodie, a blind beggar who was executed
on the 15th July, 1799, for the murder of his boy-guide,
in the Nottingham Forest, was the last
person punished with the brank. During his<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
imprisonment, prior to execution, he was so noisy
that the brank was called into requisition, to do
what he refused to do
himself, namely, to
hold his tongue.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of
a brank formerly in
the possession of the
late Mr. F. A. Carrington,
the well-known
antiquary. It
is supposed to belong
to the period of
William III. Mr. Carrington could not give any
history of this curious
relic of the
olden time.</p>

BRANK AT DODDINGTON PARK.</div>

<p>At Doddington
Park, Lincolnshire,
a brank is preserved,
and is of a
decidedly foreign
appearance. It
will be noticed that
it bears some resemblance to the peculiar long-snouted
visor of the bascinets, occasionally worn<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
in the reign of Richard II. No historical particulars
are known respecting this grotesque brank.</p>

<p>In the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, a curious
brank may be seen. It is not recorded in the
catalogue of the collection by whom it was
presented, or where it was previously used; it is
described as "a gag or brank, formerly used with
the ducking-stool, as a punishment for scolds."
It will be noticed that a chain is attached to the
front of this brank, so that the poor unfortunate
woman, in addition to being gagged, had the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
mortification of being led by the nose through the

aperture for the nose.</p>

BRANK IN THE ASHMOLEAN MUSEUM.</div>

<p>A curious engine of torture may be seen in the
Ludlow Museum, and we give an illustration
of it. It belongs to a class of engines far more
formidable than branks. A description of this
head-piece appears
in the <i>Arch&aelig;ological
Journal</i> for September,
1856, from the
pen of Mr. W. J.
Bernard Smith. "The
powerful screwing
apparatus," says Mr.
Smith, "seems calculated
to force the iron
mask with torturing
effect upon the brow
of the victim; there are no eye-holes, but concavities
in their places, as though to allow for
the starting of the eye-balls under violent
pressure. There is a strong bar with a square
hole, evidently intended to fasten the criminal
against a wall, or perhaps to the pillory; and
I have heard it said that these instruments<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
were used to keep the head steady during the
infliction of branding." A curious instrument of
punishment, belonging to the same class as
that at Ludlow, is described at some length, with
an illustration, in "Worcester in Olden Times,"
by John Noake (London, 1849). The picture and
description have been frequently reproduced.</p>

ENGINE OF TORTURE IN THE LUDLOW MUSEUM.</div>

<p>Several Shropshire branks remain at the
present time. The one at Shrewsbury does not
appear to be of any great antiquity. Its form is
simple and its character harmless. This bridle
was at one time in constant use in Shrewsbury,
and there are those yet living whose memories are
sufficiently good to carry them back to the days
when the effects of the application of the brank in
question were to be seen, rather than, as now,
imagined. The year cannot be ascertained when
this brank was first worn, but it is known to have
been last used in 1846.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>At Oswestry are two branks, one belonging to
the Corporation, and the other is in the store-room
of the Workhouse. The Rector of Whitchurch
has in his possession a brank, which was formerly
used by the town and union authorities. At
Market Drayton are two branks: one is the
property of the Lord of the Manor, and the other
formerly belonged to the Dodcot Union. The
Market Drayton brank, and also the one at
Whitchurch, have on each a revolving wheel at
the end of the gag or tongue-plate. In bygone
times, the brank was frequently used for correcting
unmanageable paupers.</p>

SHREWSBURY BRANK.</div>

<p>At Edinburgh, in the Museum of the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland, is a brank said to be
from a town in East Fifeshire, having a rowel-shaped
gag. In the year 1560, it was decided by
the Town Council of Edinburgh, that all
persons found guilty of blasphemy should be
punished by the iron brank. In North Britain, it
appears to have been used for punishing persons
guilty of immorality. On the 7th October, the
Kirk-Session of Canongate sentenced David
Persoun, convicted of this offence, to be "brankit
for four hours," while his associate in guilt, Isobel
Mountray, was "banisit the gait," that is, expelled<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
from the parish. Only a week previously, the
same Kirk-Session had issued a proclamation that
all women found guilty of this lawlessness "be
brankit six houris at the croce."</p>

<p>We close this chapter by directing attention
to the Bishop's brank, kept at St. Andrews,
respecting which a singular story is told. A
woman in a humble walk of life, named Isabel
Lindsay, stood up in the parish church of St.
Andrews, during the time of divine service, when
Archbishop Sharp was preaching, and declared
that when he was a college student he was guilty
of an illicit amour with her. She was arrested for
this statement, and brought before the Kirk-Sessions,
and by its members sentenced "to
appear for a succession of Sundays on the repentance
stool, wearing the brank."</p>

<h2>Riding the Stang.</h2>

<div class="figr" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/077.png" width="275" height="254" alt="" title="" />
RIDING THE STANG.</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> ancient custom of riding the stang still
lingers in some remote parts of the
country. Holding delinquents up to ridicule was
a favourite mode of punishment practised by our
forefathers, and riding the stang was the means
generally employed for punishing husbands who
beat their wives, or allowed themselves to
be henpecked, or were profligate in their
conduct. There are various designations for
the custom. In Yorkshire, riding the stang
is the name used; in Scotland the same
term is applied; in the South of England
skimmington-riding is the title generally employed,
and on the Continent it is known by
other appellations.</p>

<p>The mode of carrying out the ceremony is as
follows: A man having beaten his wife, the
young men of the village assume the attitude
of public censors, and arrangements are made for
riding the stang three nights in succession. A
trumpeter blows his horn loud and long as day<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
gives way to night, and the villagers are brought
together. A pole or a ladder is procured, and the
most witty man in the village is placed thereon,
mounted shoulder-high, and carried in great state
through the streets. In one hand he has a large
key or stick, and in the other a dripping-pan, and
leads the music of the crowd. Men, women, and
children join in the fun, and beat kettles, pans,
pots, or anything else that will make a noise; tin
whistles, horns, and trumpets are blown, the
noise produced being better imagined than<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
described. As soon as all is ready, a start is
made, and about every fifty yards the procession
stops, and the mounted man proclaims at the top
of his voice a rhyme suited to the nature of the
offence, somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ran, tan, tan; ran, tan, tan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sound of this pan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is to give notice that Tom Trotter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has beaten his good woman!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what, and for why?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because she ate when she was hungry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank when she was dry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran, tan, ran, tan, tan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurrah&mdash;hurrah! for this good wo-man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He beat her, he beat her, he beat her indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For spending a penny when she had need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He beat her black, he beat her blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Old Nick gets him, he'll give him his due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran, tan, tan; ran, tan, tan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll send him there in this old frying-pan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurrah&mdash;hurrah! for his good wo-man!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have an example noted at Sutton, near
Hull, in August, 1877. It was given with great
spirit by a youth, mounted after the customary
manner on a ladder, to the evident enjoyment
of a large gathering of the inhabitants, who were
enraged at the brutal treatment of a woman by
her husband:<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here we come with a ran, dan, dang:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's not for you, nor for me, we ride this stang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for &mdash;&mdash;, whose wife he did bang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He banged her, he banged her, he banged her indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He banged her, poor creature, before she stood need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took up neither tipstaff nor stower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with his fist he knocked her backwards ower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kicked her, he punched her, till he made her cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to finish all, he gave her a black eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, all you good people that live in this row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We would have you take warning, for this is our law:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any of you, your wives you do bang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're sure, we're sure, to ride you the stang."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Last night," says the <i>Sunderland Daily Post</i>
of March 1st, 1887, "some excitement was caused
in Northallerton by the celebration of the old
custom of 'riding the stang,' which is to expose
some one guilty of gross immoral practices, and of
a breach of sacred matrimonial rights. Some
hundreds of people followed the conveyance, in
which two effigies were erected and exhibited
through the principal streets. At intervals, a
person in the conveyance shouted out in rhyme
their object, and said they fully intended to make
a complete celebration of the custom, which is to
'ride the stang' three nights in succession, and
on the last night to burn the effigies on the green
near the church."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The stang was ridden at the ancient town of
Hedon, 18th, 19th, and 20th February, 1889.</p>

<p>The house of the culprit is visited several times
each night, and the proceedings kept up three
nights in succession, and a circuit of the church is
also made, as it is believed that those taking part
in the ceremony will not be amenable to the law,
if they do not omit this part of the custom.
If the offence is a very serious one, the offender is
burnt in effigy before his own door. In the olden
days, the offender himself was often compelled to
ride the stang.</p>

<p>Several of the old poets refer to this ancient
usage. Allan Ramsay, in one of his poems,
published in 1721, says:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They frae a barn a kaber raught<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And mounted wi' a bang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwisht twa's shoulders, and sat straught,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon't and <i>rade the stang</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>On her</i> that day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Geo. Roberts, of Lyme Regis, forwarded
to Sir Walter Scott some interesting notes on
skimmington-riding. He informed Sir Walter that
in the South of England: "About dusk two
individuals, one armed with a skimmer and the
other with a ladle, came out of some obscure<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
street attended by a crowd, whose laughter,
huzzas, etc., emulate the well-known <i>charivari</i> of
the French. The two performers are sometimes
in a cart, at other times on a donkey; one personating
the wife, the other the husband. They
beat each other furiously with the culinary
weapons above described, and, warmed by the
applause and presence of so many spectators (for
all turn out to see a skimmington), their dialogue
attains a freedom, except using surnames, only
comparable with their gestures. On arriving at
the house of the parties represented in the
moving drama, animation is at its height: the
crowd usually stay at the spot some minutes, and
then traverse the town. The performers are
remunerated by the spectators: the parties who
parade the streets with the performers sweep
with brooms the doors of those who are likely
to require a similar visitation."</p>

<p>Dr. King, in his "Miscellany," thus refers to
the subject:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When the young people ride the skimmington,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a general trembling in the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only he for whom the party rides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffers, but they sweep other doors besides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the hieroglyphic does appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the good woman is the master there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>According to Douce, <i>skimmington</i> is derived
from <i>skimming-ladle</i>, used in the ceremony.</p>

<p>In Butler's "Hudibras," considerable attention
is paid to the custom. A few of the lines are as
follow:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And now the cause of all their fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By slow degrees approached so near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horns, and pans, and dogs, and boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kettle-drums whose sullen dub,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds like the hooping of a tub;<br /></span>
<div class="ml4">&middot;<span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span></div>
<span class="i0">And followed with a world of tall lads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That merry ditties troll'd and ballads.<br /></span>
<div class="ml4">&middot;<span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span></div>
<span class="i0">Next pans and kettles of all keys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From trebles down to double base:<br /></span>
<div class="ml4">&middot;<span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span></div>
<span class="i0">And at fit periods the whole rout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set up their throat with clamorous shout."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A notice of an old Welsh ceremony appeared in
the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i> on March 15th, 1887, and
it will not be without interest to reproduce it.
"That ancient Welsh custom," says the writer,
"now nearly obsolete, known as riding the ceffyl
pren&mdash;<i>Anglic&eacute;</i>, 'wooden-horse'&mdash;and intended to
operate as a wholesome warning to faithless wives
and husbands, was revived on Saturday night in
an Anglesey village some three miles from<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Llangefni. The individual who had drawn upon
himself the odium of his neighbours had parted
from his wife, and was alleged to be persistent
in his attentions to another female. On Saturday
night a large party surrounded the house,
and compelled him to get astride a ladder, carrying
him shoulder-high through the village,
stopping at certain points to allow the womankind
to wreak their vengeance upon him. This
amusement was kept up for some time until the
opportune arrival of a sergeant of police from
Llangefni, who rescued the unlucky wight."</p>

<p>"We are glad to welcome yet another volume from the author of 'The
Cross in Ritual, Architecture, and Art.' His subject, chosen widely and
carried out comprehensively, makes this a valuable book of reference for
all classes. It is only the antiquary and the ecclesiologist who can devote
time and talents to research of this kind, and Mr. Tyack has done a real
and lasting service to the Church of England by collecting so much useful
and reliable information upon the dress of the clergy in all ages, and offering
it to the public in such a popular form. We do not hesitate to recommend
this volume as the most reliable and the most comprehensive illustrated
guide to the history and origin of the canonical vestments and other dress
worn by the clergy, whether ecclesiastical, academical, or general, while
the excellent work in typography and binding make it a beautiful gift-book."&mdash;<i>Church

<p>"Mr. Sidney Clarke's concise monograph in 'The Miracle Play in
England' is another of the long and interesting series of antiquarian
volumes for popular reading issued by the same publishing house. The
author briefly sketches the rise and growth of the 'Miracle' or 'Mystery'
play in Europe and in England; and gives an account of the series or
cycle of these curious religious dramas&mdash;the forerunners of the modern
secular play&mdash;performed at York, Wakefield, Chester, Coventry, and
other towns in the middle ages. But his chief efforts are devoted to
giving a sketch of the manner of production, and the scenery, properties,
and dresses of the old miracle play, as drawn from the minute account
books of the craft and trade guilds and other authentic records of the
period. Mr. Clarke has gone to the best sources for his information,
and the volume, illustrated by quaint cuts, is an excellent compendium
of information on a curious byeway of literature and art."&mdash;<i>The
